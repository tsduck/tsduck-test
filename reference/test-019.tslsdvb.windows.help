  --adapter N
      Specifies the Nth tuner device in the system. This option can be used
      instead of device name.

  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  -d name
  --device-name name
      Specify the receiver device name. This is a DirectShow/BDA tuner filter
      name (not case sensitive, blanks are ignored). By default, the first
      receiver device is used. Use the tslsdvb utility to list all DVB devices.
