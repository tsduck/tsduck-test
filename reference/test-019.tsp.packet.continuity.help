Check or fix continuity counters on TS packets

Usage: tsp -P continuity [options]

Options:

  -f
  --fix
      Fix incorrect continuity counters. By default, only display
      discontinuities.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --no-replicate-duplicated
      Two successive packets in the same PID are considered as duplicated if
      they have the same continuity counter and same content (except PCR, if
      any). By default, with --fix, duplicated input packets are replicated as
      duplicated on output (the corresponding output packets have the same
      continuity counters). When this option is specified, the input packets
      are not considered as duplicated and the output packets receive
      individually incremented countinuity counters.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  -p pid1[-pid2]
  --pid pid1[-pid2]
      Check or fix continuity counters only in packets with this PID value or
      range of values. Several -p or --pid options may be specified. By
      default, all PID's are checked or fixed.

  -t 'string'
  --tag 'string'
      Message tag to be displayed when packets are missing. Useful when the
      plugin is used several times in the same process.
