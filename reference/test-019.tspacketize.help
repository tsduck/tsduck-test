Packetize PSI/SI sections in a transport stream PID

Usage: tspacketize [options] [input-file[=rate] ...]

Parameters:

  Input binary, XML or JSON files containing one or more sections or tables. By
  default, files ending in .bin, .xml or .json are automatically recognized.
  For other file names, explicitly specify --binary, --xml or --json. If the
  file name is omitted, the standard input is used (binary by default, specify
  --xml or --json otherwise).

  The reference source format is XML. JSON files are first translated to XML
  using the "automated XML-to-JSON conversion" rules of TSDuck and then
  compiled to binary.

  If different repetition rates are required for different files, a parameter
  can be "filename=value" where value is the repetition rate in milliseconds
  for all sections in that file. For repetition rates to be effective, the
  bitrate of the target PID must be specified, see option -b or --bitrate.

Options:

  --binary
      Specify that all input files are binary, regardless of their file name.

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      Specifies the bitrate (in bits/second) of the target PID. This
      information is used to schedule sections in the output list of packets
      when specific bitrates are specified for sections.
      The value must be a 64-bit floating-point value.

  --brazil
      A synonym for '--default-charset RAW-ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy
      shortcut when working on South American ISDB-Tb transport streams.

  -c
  --continuous
      Continuous packetization. By default, generate one cycle of sections.

  -d[level]
  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting strings from tables and
      descriptors. By default, DVB encoding using ISO-6937 as default table is
      used. The available table names are ARIB, ARIB-STD-B24, DUMP, DVB,
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6,
      ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, RAW-ISO-6937, RAW-ISO-8859-1,
      RAW-ISO-8859-10, RAW-ISO-8859-11, RAW-ISO-8859-13, RAW-ISO-8859-14,
      RAW-ISO-8859-15, RAW-ISO-8859-2, RAW-ISO-8859-3, RAW-ISO-8859-4,
      RAW-ISO-8859-5, RAW-ISO-8859-6, RAW-ISO-8859-7, RAW-ISO-8859-8,
      RAW-ISO-8859-9, RAW-UNICODE, RAW-UTF-8, UNICODE, UTF-8.

  --eit-base-date date
      With --eit-normalization, use the specified date as "last midnight"
      reference for the allocation of the various EIT events in sections and
      segments. The date must be in the format "year/month/day". By default,
      use the oldest date in all EIT sections as base date.

  --eit-normalization
      Reorganize all EIT sections according to ETSI TS 101 211 rules. One
      single EIT p/f subtable is built per service. It is split in two
      sections, one for present and one for following events. All EIT schedule
      are kept but they are completely reorganized. All events are extracted
      and spread over new EIT sections according to ETSI TS 101 211 rules. If
      several files are specified, the reorganization of EIT's is performed
      inside each file independently. This is fine as long as all EIT's for a
      given service are in the same input file. See also option
      --eit-base-date.

  --europe
      A synonym for '--default-charset ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy shortcut
      for commonly incorrect signalization on some European satellites. In that
      signalization, the character encoding is ISO-8859-15, the most common
      encoding for Latin & Western Europe languages. However, this is not the
      default DVB character set and it should be properly specified in all
      strings, which is not the case with some operators. Using this option,
      all DVB strings without explicit table code are assumed to use
      ISO-8859-15 instead of the standard ISO-6937 encoding.

  -f
  --force-crc
      Force recomputation of CRC32 in long sections. Ignore the CRC32 values in
      the input files.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --japan
      A synonym for '--default-charset ARIB-STD-B24'. This is a handy shortcut
      when working on Japanese transport streams.

  -j
  --json
      Specify that all input files are JSON, regardless of their file name.

  -o file-name
  --output file-name
      Output file name for TS packets. By default, use standard output.

  --pack-and-flush
      When loading a binary section file, pack incomplete tables and flush
      them. Sections are renumbered to remove any hole between sections. Use
      with care because this may create inconsistent tables.

  --philippines
      A synonym for '--default-charset RAW-UTF-8'. This is a handy shortcut
      when working on Philippines transport streams.

  -p value
  --pid value
      PID of the output TS packets. This is a required parameter, there is no
      default value.

  -s
  --stuffing
      Insert stuffing at end of each section, up to the next TS packet
      boundary. By default, sections are packed and start in the middle of a TS
      packet, after the previous section. Note, however, that section headers
      are never scattered over a packet boundary.

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version
      Display the TSDuck version number.

  -x
  --xml
      Specify that all input files are XML, regardless of their file name.
