TS input source switch using remote control

Usage: tsswitch [tsswitch-options] -I input-name [input-options] ... [-O output-name [output-options]]

Options:

  -a value
  --allow value
      Specify an IP address or host name which is allowed to send remote
      commands. Several --allow options are allowed. By default, all remote
      commands are accepted.

  -b value
  --buffer-packets value
      Specify the size in TS packets of each input plugin buffer. The default
      is 512 packets.

  -c value
  --cycle value
      Specify how many times to repeat the cycle through all input plugins in
      sequence. By default, all input plugins are executed in sequence only
      once (--cycle 1). The options --cycle, --infinite and --terminate are
      mutually exclusive.

  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  -d
  --delayed-switch
      Perform delayed input switching. When switching from one input plugin to
      another one, the second plugin is started first. Packets from the first
      plugin continue to be output while the second plugin is starting. Then,
      after the second plugin starts to receive packets, the switch occurs:
      packets are now fetched from the second plugin. Finally, after the
      switch, the first plugin is stopped.

  -f
  --fast-switch
      Perform fast input switching. All input plugins are started at once and
      they continuously receive packets in parallel. Packets are dropped,
      except for the current input plugin. This option is typically used when
      all inputs are live streams on distinct devices (not the same DVB tuner
      for instance).

      By default, only one input plugin is started at a time. When switching,
      the current input is first stopped and then the next one is started.

  --first-input value
      Specify the index of the first input plugin to start. By default, the
      first plugin (index 0) is used.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i
  --infinite
      Infinitely repeat the cycle through all input plugins in sequence.

  --log-message-count value
      Specify the maximum number of buffered log messages. Log messages are
      displayed asynchronously in a low priority thread. This value specifies
      the maximum number of buffered log messages in memory, before being
      displayed. When too many messages are logged in a short period of time,
      while plugins use all CPU power, extra messages are dropped. Increase
      this value if you think that too many messages are dropped. The default
      is 512 messages.

  --max-input-packets value
      Specify the maximum number of TS packets to read at a time. This value
      may impact the switch response time. The default is 128 packets. The
      actual value is never more than half the --buffer-packets value.

  --max-output-packets value
      Specify the maximum number of TS packets to write at a time. The default
      is 128 packets.

  -m
  --monitor
      Continuously monitor the system resources which are used by tsswitch.
      This includes CPU load, virtual memory usage. Useful to verify the
      stability of the application.

  --no-reuse-port
      Disable the reuse port socket option for the remote control. Do not use
      unless completely necessary.

  -p value
  --primary-input value
      Specify the index of the input plugin which is considered as primary or
      preferred. This input plugin is always started, never stopped, even
      without --fast-switch. When no packet is received on this plugin, the
      normal switching rules apply. However, as soon as packets are back on the
      primary input, the reception is immediately switched back to it. By
      default, there is no primary input, all input plugins are equal.

  --receive-timeout value
      Specify a receive timeout in milliseconds. When the current input plugin
      has received no packet within this timeout, automatically switch to the
      next plugin. By default, without --primary-input, there is no automatic
      switch when the current input plugin is waiting for packets. With
      --primary-input, the default is 2,000 ms.

  -r [address:]port
  --remote [address:]port
      Specify the local UDP port which is used to receive remote commands. If
      an optional address is specified, it must be a local IP address of the
      system. By default, there is no remote control.

  -s
  --synchronous-log
      Each logged message is guaranteed to be displayed, synchronously, without
      any loss of message. The downside is that a plugin thread may be blocked
      for a short while when too many messages are logged. This option shall be
      used when all log messages are needed and the source and destination are
      not live streams (files for instance). This option is not recommended for
      live streams, when the responsiveness of the application is more
      important than the logged messages.

  -t
  --terminate
      Terminate execution when the current input plugin terminates.

  --timed-log
      Each logged message contains a time stamp.

  --udp-buffer-size value
      Specifies the UDP socket receive buffer size (socket option).

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version
      Display the TSDuck version number.
