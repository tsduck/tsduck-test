  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  -s
  --stuffing
      Replace excluded leading packets with stuffing (null packets) instead of
      removing them.
