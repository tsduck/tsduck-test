Report a history of major events on the transport stream

Usage: tsp -P history [options]

Options:

  -c
  --cas
      Report all CAS events (ECM, crypto-periods).

  -e
  --eit
      Report all EIT. By default, EIT are not reported.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i
  --ignore-stream-id-change
      Do not report stream_id modifications in a stream. Some subtitle streams
      may constantly swap between "private stream" and "padding stream". This
      option suppresses these annoying messages.

  -m
  --milli-seconds
      For each message, report time in milli-seconds from the beginning of the
      stream instead of the TS packet number. This time is a playback time based
      on the current TS bitrate (use plugin pcrbitrate when necessary).


  -o filename
  --output-file filename
      Specify the output file for reporting history lines. By default, report
      history lines on standard error using the tsp logging mechanism.

  -s value
  --suspend-packet-threshold value
      Number of packets in TS after which a PID is considered as suspended.
      By default, if no packet is found in a PID during 60 seconds, the PID
      is considered as suspended.

  -t
  --time-all
      Report all TDT and TOT. By default, only report TDT preceeding
      another event.

Without option --output-file, output is formated as:
  * history: PKT#: MESSAGE

Some messages may be out of sync. To sort messages according to their packet
numbers, use a command like:
  tsp -P history ...  2>&1 | grep '* history:' | sort -t : -k 2 -n

When an output file is specified using --output-file, the sort command becomes:
  sort -n output-file-name
