Add stuffing to a transport stream to reach a target bitrate

Usage: tsstuff [options] [input-file]

Parameter:

  The input file is a TS file, typically with variable bitrate content. By
  default, the standard input is used.

Options:

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      Target constant bitrate of the output file. This is mandatory parameter,
      there is no default.
      The value must be a 64-bit floating-point value.

  --buffer-size value
      Input buffer size, in bytes. Must be large enough to always contain two
      time stamps in the reference PID. Default: 4,194,304 bytes.

  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  -d
  --dts-based
      Use Decoding Time Stamps (DTS) in the reference PID to evaluate the
      amount of stuffing to insert. The default is to use Program Clock
      References (PCR) instead of DTS.

  -f value
  --final-inter-packet value
      Number of stuffing packets to add between input packets after the last
      time stamp (PCR or DTS). By default, use the same number as in the
      previous segment, between the last two time stamps.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i value
  --initial-inter-packet value
      Number of stuffing packets to add between input packets before the first
      time stamp (PCR or DTS). By default, use the same number as in the first
      segment, between the first two time stamps.

  --input-format name
      Specify the format of the input TS file. By default, the format is
      automatically detected. But the auto-detection may fail in some cases
      (for instance when the first time-stamp of an M2TS file starts with
      0x47). Using this option forces a specific format.
      Must be one of "M2TS", "RS204", "TS", "autodetect", "duck".

  -l value
  --leading-packets value
      Number of consecutive stuffing packets to add at the beginning of the
      output file, before the first input packet. The default is zero.

  -m value
  --min-interval value
      Minimum interval, in milli-seconds, between two recomputations of the
      amount of stuffing to insert. This duration is based on time-stamps, not
      real time. The default is 100 ms.

  -o filename
  --output-file filename
      Output file name (standard output by default). The output file is a TS
      file with the same packets as the input file with interspersed stuffing
      packets and a constant bitrate.

  --output-format name
      Specify the format of the output TS file. By default, the format is a
      standard TS file.
      Must be one of "M2TS", "RS204", "TS", "duck".

  -r value
  --reference-pid value
      PID in which to collect time stamps (PCR or DTS) to use as reference for
      the insertion of stuffing packets. By default, use the first PID
      containing the specified type of time stamps (PCR or DTS).

  -t value
  --trailing-packets value
      Number of consecutive stuffing packets to add at the end of the output
      file, after the last input packet. The default is zero.

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version
      Display the TSDuck version number.
