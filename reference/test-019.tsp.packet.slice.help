Pass or drop packets based on packet numbers.

Usage: tsp -P slice [options]

Options:

  -d value
  --drop value
      All packets are dropped after the specified packet number.
      Several --drop options may be specified.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i
  --ignore-pcr
      When --seconds or --milli-seconds is used, do not use PCR's to
      compute time values. Only rely on bitrate as determined by previous
      plugins in the chain.

  -m
  --milli-seconds
      With options --drop, --null, --pass and --stop, interpret the integer
      values as milli-seconds from the beginning, not as packet numbers.
      Time is measured based on bitrate and packet count, not on real time.

  -n value
  --null value
      All packets are replaced by null packets after the specified packet
      number. Several --null options may be specified.

  -p value
  --pass value
      All packets are passed unmodified after the specified packet number.
      Several --pass options may be specified. This is the default for the
      initial packets.

  --seconds
      With options --drop, --null, --pass and --stop, interpret the integer
      values as seconds from the beginning, not as packet numbers.
      Time is measured based on bitrate and packet count, not on real time.

  -s value
  --stop value
      Packet transmission stops after the specified packet number and tsp
      terminates.

  --version
      Display the version number.
