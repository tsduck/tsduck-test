Collect PSI/SI tables from an MPEG transport stream

Usage: tstables [options] [filename]

Parameter:

  Input transport stream file (standard input if omitted).

Options:

  --abnt
      Assume that the transport stream is an ISDB one with ABNT-defined
      variants. ISDB streams are normally automatically detected from their
      signalization but there is no way to determine if this is an original
      ARIB-defined ISDB or an ABNT-defined variant.

  --all-once
      Same as --all-sections but collect each section only once per combination
      of PID, table id, table id extension, section number and version.

  -a
  --all-sections
      Display/save all sections, as they appear in the stream. By default,
      collect complete tables, with all sections of the tables grouped and
      ordered and collect each version of a table only once. Note that this
      mode is incompatible with XML or JSON output since valid XML or JSON
      structures may contain complete tables only.

  --atsc
      Assume that the transport stream is an ATSC one. ATSC streams are
      normally automatically detected from their signalization. This option is
      only useful when ATSC-related stuff are found in the TS before the first
      ATSC-specific table. For instance, when a PMT with ATSC-specific
      descriptors is found before the first ATSC MGT or VCT.

  -b file-name
  --binary-output file-name
      Save sections in the specified binary output file. If empty or '-', the
      binary sections are written to the standard output. See also option -m,
      --multiple-files.

  --brazil
      A synonym for '--isdb --abnt --default-charset RAW-ISO-8859-15
      --time-reference UTC-3'. This is a handy shortcut when working on South
      American ISDB-Tb transport streams.

  -c
  --c-style
      Same as --raw-dump (no interpretation of section) but dump the bytes in
      C-language style.

  --conax
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x0B00.

  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  --default-cas-id value
      Interpret all EMM's and ECM's from unknown CAS as coming from the
      specified CA_System_Id. By default, EMM's and ECM's are interpreted
      according to the CA_descriptor which references their PID. This option is
      useful when analyzing partial transport streams without CAT or PMT to
      correctly identify the CA PID's.

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting strings from tables and
      descriptors. By default, DVB encoding using ISO-6937 as default table is
      used. The available table names are ARIB, ARIB-STD-B24, DUMP, DVB,
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6,
      ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, RAW-ISO-6937, RAW-ISO-8859-1,
      RAW-ISO-8859-10, RAW-ISO-8859-11, RAW-ISO-8859-13, RAW-ISO-8859-14,
      RAW-ISO-8859-15, RAW-ISO-8859-2, RAW-ISO-8859-3, RAW-ISO-8859-4,
      RAW-ISO-8859-5, RAW-ISO-8859-6, RAW-ISO-8859-7, RAW-ISO-8859-8,
      RAW-ISO-8859-9, RAW-UNICODE, RAW-UTF-8, UNICODE, UTF-8.

  --default-pds value
      Default private data specifier. This option is meaningful only when the
      signalization is incorrect, when DVB private descriptors appear in tables
      without a preceding private_data_specifier_descriptor. The specified
      value is used as private data specifier to interpret DVB private
      descriptors. The PDS value can be an integer or one of (not
      case-sensitive) names.
      The 'value' must be one of "AOM", "Australia", "AVSA", "AVSV", "BskyB",
      "CanalPlus", "cuvv", "EACEM", "EICTA", "Eutelsat", "Logiways", "Nagra",
      "NorDig", "OFCOM", "TPS".

  --default-registration value
      Default registration id. This option is meaningful only when the
      signalization is incorrect, when MPEG private descriptors appear in
      tables without a preceding registration_descriptor. The specified value
      is used as registration id (also know as format identifier) to interpret
      MPEG private descriptors or stream types.
      Several options --default-registration can be specified. Unlike DVB
      private data specifiers, several MPEG registration ids can be
      simultaneously defined.

  -d
  --diversified-payload
      Select only sections with "diversified" payload. This means that section
      payloads containing the same byte value (all 0x00 or all 0xFF for
      instance) are ignored. Typically, such sections are stuffing and can be
      ignored that way.

  --dvb
      Assume that the transport stream is a DVB one. DVB streams are normally
      automatically detected from their signalization. This option is only
      useful when possibly incorrect non-DVB stuff are found in the TS before
      the first DVB-specific table.

  --europe
      A synonym for '--dvb --default-charset ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy
      shortcut for commonly incorrect signalization on some European
      satellites. In that signalization, the character encoding is ISO-8859-15,
      the most common encoding for Latin & Western Europe languages. However,
      this is not the default DVB character set and it should be properly
      specified in all strings, which is not the case with some operators.
      Using this option, all DVB strings without explicit table code are
      assumed to use ISO-8859-15 instead of the standard ISO-6937 encoding.

  --exclude-current
      Exclude short sections and long sections with "current" indicator. This
      is rarely necessary. See also --include-next.

  --fill-eit
      Before exiting, add missing empty sections in EIT's and flush them. This
      can be useful with segmented EIT schedule where empty sections at end of
      segments are usually not transmitted.

  -f
  --flush
      Flush output after each display.

  --format name
      Specify the format of the input TS file. By default, the format is
      automatically detected. But the auto-detection may fail in some cases
      (for instance when the first time-stamp of an M2TS file starts with
      0x47). Using this option forces a specific format.
      The 'name' must be one of "autodetect", "duck", "M2TS", "RS204", "TS".

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --ignore-leap-seconds
      Do not include explicit leap seconds in some UTC computations. Currently,
      this applies to SCTE 35 splice_schedule() commands only.

  --include-next
      Include long sections with "next" indicator. By default, they are
      excluded.

  --invalid-sections
      Display and dump invalid sections. These sections are normally dropped
      because they are truncated, incomplete, corrupted, have an invalid CRC32,
      etc. Because these sections are invalid, they cannot be formatted as
      normal sections. Instead, a binary and text dump is displayed.

  --invalid-versions
      Track invalid version numbers in sections. Per MPEG rules, the version
      number of a section with long header shall be updated each time the
      content of the section is updated. With this option, the content of the
      sections is tracked to detect modified sections without version updates.
      These events are considered as errors.

  -i address:port
  --ip-udp address:port
      Send the tables or individual sections over UDP/IP to the specified
      destination. The 'address' specifies an IP address which can be either
      unicast or multicast. It can be also a host name that translates to an IP
      address. The 'port' specifies the destination UDP port. See also option
      --udp-format.

  --irdeto
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x0600.

  --isdb
      Assume that the transport stream is an ISDB one. ISDB streams are
      normally automatically detected from their signalization. This option is
      only useful when ISDB-related stuff are found in the TS before the first
      ISDB-specific table.

  --japan
      A synonym for '--isdb --default-charset ARIB-STD-B24 --time-reference
      JST'. This is a handy shortcut when working on Japanese transport
      streams.

  --json-output file-name
      Save the tables in JSON format in the specified file. The tables are
      initially formatted as XML and automated XML-to-JSON conversion is
      applied. To output the JSON text on the standard output, explicitly
      specify this option with "-" as output file name.

  --local-udp address
      With --ip-udp, when the destination is a multicast address, specify the
      IP address of the outgoing local interface. It can be also a host name
      that translates to a local address.

  --log
      Display a short one-line log of each table instead of full table display.

  --log-hexa-line[='prefix']
      Log each binary table or section (with --all-sections) as one single
      hexadecimal line in the message logger instead of an output binary file.
      The optional string parameter specifies a prefix to prepend on the log
      line before the hexadecimal text to locate the appropriate line in the
      logs.

  --log-json-line[='prefix']
      Log each table as one single JSON line in the message logger instead of
      an output file. The table is formatted as XML and automated XML-to-JSON
      conversion is applied. The optional string parameter specifies a prefix
      to prepend on the log line before the JSON text to locate the appropriate
      line in the logs.

  --log-size value
      With option --log, specify how many bytes are displayed at the beginning
      of the table payload (the header is not displayed). The default is 8
      bytes.

  --log-xml-line[='prefix']
      Log each table as one single XML line in the message logger instead of an
      output file. The optional string parameter specifies a prefix to prepend
      on the log line before the XML text to locate the appropriate line in the
      logs.

  -x value
  --max-tables value
      Maximum number of tables to dump. Stop logging tables when this limit is
      reached.

  --mediaguard
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x0100.

  --meta-sections
      Add hexadecimal dump of each section in XML and JSON metadata.

  -m
  --multiple-files
      Create multiple binary output files, one per section. A binary output
      file name must be specified (option -b or --binary-output). Assuming that
      the specified file name has the form 'base.ext', each file is created
      with the name 'base_pXXXX_tXX.ext' for short sections and
      'base_pXXXX_tXX_eXXXX_vXX_sXX.ext' for long sections, where the XX
      specify the hexadecimal values of the PID, TID (table id), TIDext (table
      id extension), version and section index.

  --nagravision
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x1800.

  --nds
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x0900.

  --negate-pid
      Negate the PID filter: specified PID's are excluded. Warning: this can be
      a dangerous option on complete transport streams since PID's not
      containing sections can be accidentally selected.

  --negate-section-number
      Negate the section number filter: specified sections are excluded.

  -n
  --negate-tid
      Negate the TID filter: specified TID's are excluded.

  --negate-tid-ext
      Negate the TID extension filter: specified TID extensions are excluded.

  --nested-tlv[=min-size]
      With option --tlv, try to interpret the value field of each TLV record as
      another TLV area. If the min-size value is specified, the nested TLV
      interpretation is performed only on value fields larger than this size.
      The syntax of the nested TLV is the same as the enclosing TLV.

  --no-deep-duplicate
      Do not report identical sections in the same PID, even when
      non-consecutive. A hash of each section is kept for each PID and later
      identical sections are not reported.
      Warning: This option accumulates memory for hash values of all sections
      since the beginning. Do not use that option for commands running too long
      or the process may crash with insufficient memory.

  --no-duplicate
      Do not report consecutive identical tables with a short section in the
      same PID. This can be useful for ECM's. This is the way to display new
      ECM's only. By default, tables with long sections are reported only when
      a new version is detected but tables with a short section are all
      reported.

  --no-encapsulation
      With --ip-udp, send the tables as raw binary messages in UDP packets. By
      default, the tables are formatted into TLV messages. Ignored if
      --udp-format is not binary.

  --no-pager
      Do not send output through a pager process. By default, if the output
      device is a terminal, the output is paged.

  --only-invalid-sections
      Same as --invalid-sections but do not display valid tables and sections.

  -o file-name
  --output-file file-name
      Save the tables or sections in human-readable text format in the
      specified file. By default, when no output option is specified, text is
      produced on the standard output. If you need text formatting on the
      standard output in addition to other output like binary files or UPD/IP,
      explicitly specify this option with "-" as output file name.

      By default, the tables are interpreted and formatted as text on the
      standard output. Several destinations can be specified at the same time:
      human-readable text output, binary output, UDP/IP messages.

  --pack-all-sections
      Same as --all-sections but also modify each long section so that it
      becomes a valid complete table. Its section_number and
      last_section_number are forced to zero. Use with care because this may
      create inconsistent tables. This option can be useful with tables with
      sparse sections such as EIT's to save them in XML format (as an
      alternative, see also --fill-eit).

  --pack-and-flush
      Before exiting, pack incomplete tables, ignoring missing sections, and
      flush them. Use with care because this may create inconsistent tables.
      Unlike option --pack-all-sections, --pack-and-flush does not force
      --all-sections because it only applies to the last incomplete tables
      before exiting.

  --packet-index
      Display the index of the first and last TS packet of each displayed
      section or table.

  --philippines
      A synonym for '--isdb --abnt --default-charset RAW-UTF-8 --time-reference
      UTC+8'. This is a handy shortcut when working on Philippines transport
      streams.

  -p pid1[-pid2]
  --pid pid1[-pid2]
      PID filter: select packets with this PID value or range of PID values.
      Several -p or --pid options may be specified. Without -p or --pid option,
      all PID's are used (this can be a dangerous option on complete transport
      streams since PID's not containing sections can be accidentally
      selected).

  --psi-si
      Add all PID's containing PSI/SI tables, ie. PAT, CAT, PMT, NIT, SDT and
      BAT. Note that EIT, TDT and TOT are not included. Use --pid 18 to get EIT
      and --pid 20 to get TDT and TOT.

  -r
  --raw-dump
      Raw dump of section, no interpretation.

  --rewrite-binary
      With --binary-output, rewrite the same file with each table. The
      specified file always contains one single table, the latest one.

  --rewrite-json
      With --json-output, rewrite the same file with each table. The specified
      file always contains one single table, the latest one.

  --rewrite-xml
      With --xml-output, rewrite the same file with each table. The specified
      file always contains one single table, the latest one.

  --safeaccess
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x4ADC.

  --section-content hexa-data
      Binary content filter: Specify binary data that must match the beginning
      of the section. The value must be a string of hexadecimal digits
      specifying any number of bytes. See also option --section-mask to specify
      selected bits or bytes only.

  --section-mask hexa-data
      With --section-content, specify a mask of meaningful bits in the binary
      data that must match the beginning of the section. The value must be a
      string of hexadecimal digits specifying any number of bytes. If omitted
      or shorter than the --section-content parameter, the mask is implicitely
      padded with FF bytes.

  --section-number num1[-num2]
      Section number filter: when sections are filtered individually instead of
      complete tables, select sections with this section number or range of
      section numbers. Several --section-number options may be specified.

  --strict-xml
      Save XML documents in strictly conformant XML format. By default, do not
      escape characters when this is not syntactically necessary to make the
      XML text more human-readable.

  --text-output file-name
      A synonym for --output-file.

  -t tid1[-tid2]
  --tid tid1[-tid2]
      TID filter: select sections with this TID (table id) value or range of
      TID values. Several -t or --tid options may be specified. Without -t or
      --tid option, all tables are saved.

  -e ext1[-ext2]
  --tid-ext ext1[-ext2]
      TID extension filter: select sections with this table id extension value
      or range of values (apply to long sections only). Several -e or --tid-ext
      options may be specified. Without -e or --tid-ext option, all tables are
      saved.

  --time-reference name
      Use a non-standard (non-UTC) time reference in TDT/TOT. This is typically
      used in ARIB ISDB and ABNT ISDB-Tb standards. The specified name can be
      either 'UTC', 'JST' (Japan Standard Time) or 'UTC+|-hh[:mm]'. Examples:
      'UTC+9' (same as 'JST' for ARIB ISDB), 'UTC-3' (for ABNT ISDB-Tb in
      Brazil).

  --time-stamp
      Display a time stamp (current local time) with each table.

  --tlv value
      For sections of unknown types, this option specifies how to interpret
      some parts of the section payload as TLV records. Several --tlv options
      are allowed, each one describes a part of the section payload.

      Each syntax string has the form "start,size,tagSize,lengthSize,order".
      The start and size fields define the offset and size of the TLV area in
      the section payload. If the size field is "auto", the TLV extends up to
      the end of the section. If the start field is "auto", the longest TLV
      area in the section payload will be used. The fields tagSize and
      lengthSize indicate the size in bytes of the Tag and Length fields in the
      TLV structure. The field order must be either "msb" or "lsb" and
      indicates the byte order of the Tag and Length fields.

      All fields are optional. The default values are "auto,auto,1,1,msb".

  --ttl value
      With --ip-udp, specifies the TTL (Time-To-Live) socket option. The actual
      option is either "Unicast TTL" or "Multicast TTL", depending on the
      destination address. Remember that the default Multicast TTL is 1 on most
      systems.

  --udp-format value
      With --ip-udp, specify the format of sections in the UDP datagrams. The
      default is binary. With --all-sections or --all-once, the only allowed
      format is binary.
      The 'value' must be one of "binary", "JSON", "XML".

  --usa
      A synonym for '--atsc'. This is a handy shortcut when working on North
      American transport streams.

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version[=name]
      Display the TSDuck version number.
      The 'name' must be one of "acceleration", "all", "bitrate", "compiler",
      "crypto", "date", "dektec", "http", "integer", "long", "nsis", "rist",
      "short", "srt", "system", "vatek".

  --viaccess
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x0500.

  --widevine
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x4AD4.

  --x2j-collapse-text
      In the XML-to-JSON conversion, remove leading and trailing spaces and
      replace all other sequences of space characters by one single space in
      all text nodes. By default, text nodes are collapsed only when there is
      an XML model which identifies the text node as containing hexadecimal
      content.

  --x2j-enforce-boolean
      In the XML-to-JSON conversion, when an element attribute contains a
      boolean value but there is no XML model file to tell if this is really a
      boolean, force the creation of a JSON boolean. By default, when there is
      no XML model, all element attributes are converted as JSON strings.

  --x2j-enforce-integer
      In the XML-to-JSON conversion, when an element attribute contains an
      integer value but there is no XML model file to tell if this is really an
      integer, force the creation of a JSON number. By default, when there is
      no XML model, all element attributes are converted as JSON strings.

  --x2j-include-root
      In the XML-to-JSON conversion, keep the root of the XML document as a
      JSON object. By default, the JSON document is made of an array of all XML
      elements under the root.

  --x2j-trim-text
      In the XML-to-JSON conversion, remove leading and trailing spaces in all
      text nodes. By default, text nodes are trimmed only when there is an XML
      model which identifies the text node as containing hexadecimal content.

  --xml-output file-name
      Save the tables in XML format in the specified file. To output the XML
      text on the standard output, explicitly specify this option with "-" as
      output file name.
