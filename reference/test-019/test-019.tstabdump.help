Dump PSI/SI tables, as saved by tstables

Usage: tstabdump [options] [filename ...]

Parameters:

  Input binary section file. Several files can be specified. By default,
  without file and without --ip-udp, the binary tables are read from the
  standard input.

  With --ip-udp, no file shall be specified. Binary sections and tables are
  received over UDP/IP as sent by the utility 'tstables' or the plugin
  'tables'.

Options:

  --abnt
      Assume that the transport stream is an ISDB one with ABNT-defined
      variants. ISDB streams are normally automatically detected from their
      signalization but there is no way to determine if this is an original
      ARIB-defined ISDB or an ABNT-defined variant.

  --atsc
      Assume that the transport stream is an ATSC one. ATSC streams are
      normally automatically detected from their signalization. This option is
      only useful when ATSC-related stuff are found in the TS before the first
      ATSC-specific table. For instance, when a PMT with ATSC-specific
      descriptors is found before the first ATSC MGT or VCT.

  --brazil
      A synonym for '--isdb --abnt --default-charset RAW-ISO-8859-15
      --time-reference UTC-3'. This is a handy shortcut when working on South
      American ISDB-Tb transport streams.

  --buffer-size value
      Specify the UDP socket receive buffer size in bytes (socket option).

  -c
  --c-style
      Same as --raw-dump (no interpretation of section) but dump the bytes in
      C-language style.

  --conax
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x0B00.

  -d[level]
  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  --default-cas-id value
      Interpret all EMM's and ECM's from unknown CAS as coming from the
      specified CA_System_Id. By default, EMM's and ECM's are interpreted
      according to the CA_descriptor which references their PID. This option is
      useful when analyzing partial transport streams without CAT or PMT to
      correctly identify the CA PID's.

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting strings from tables and
      descriptors. By default, DVB encoding using ISO-6937 as default table is
      used. The available table names are ARIB, ARIB-STD-B24, DUMP, DVB,
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6,
      ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, RAW-ISO-6937, RAW-ISO-8859-1,
      RAW-ISO-8859-10, RAW-ISO-8859-11, RAW-ISO-8859-13, RAW-ISO-8859-14,
      RAW-ISO-8859-15, RAW-ISO-8859-2, RAW-ISO-8859-3, RAW-ISO-8859-4,
      RAW-ISO-8859-5, RAW-ISO-8859-6, RAW-ISO-8859-7, RAW-ISO-8859-8,
      RAW-ISO-8859-9, RAW-UNICODE, RAW-UTF-8, UNICODE, UTF-8.

  --default-interface
      Let the system find the appropriate local interface on which to listen.
      By default, listen on all local interfaces.

  --default-pds value
      Default private data specifier. This option is meaningful only when the
      signalization is incorrect, when DVB private descriptors appear in tables
      without a preceding private_data_specifier_descriptor. The specified
      value is used as private data specifier to interpret DVB private
      descriptors. The PDS value can be an integer or one of (not
      case-sensitive) names.
      The 'value' must be one of "AOM", "Australia", "AVSA", "AVSV", "BskyB",
      "CanalPlus", "cuvv", "EACEM", "EICTA", "Eutelsat", "Logiways", "Nagra",
      "NorDig", "OFCOM", "TPS".

  --default-registration value
      Default registration id. This option is meaningful only when the
      signalization is incorrect, when MPEG private descriptors appear in
      tables without a preceding registration_descriptor. The specified value
      is used as registration id (also know as format identifier) to interpret
      MPEG private descriptors or stream types.
      Several options --default-registration can be specified. Unlike DVB
      private data specifiers, several MPEG registration ids can be
      simultaneously defined.

  --disable-multicast-loop
      Disable multicast loopback. By default, incoming multicast packets are
      looped back on local interfaces, if an application sends packets to the
      same group from the same system. This option disables this.
      Warning: On input sockets, this option is effective only on Windows
      systems. On Unix systems (Linux, macOS, BSD), this option applies only to
      output sockets.

  --dvb
      Assume that the transport stream is a DVB one. DVB streams are normally
      automatically detected from their signalization. This option is only
      useful when possibly incorrect non-DVB stuff are found in the TS before
      the first DVB-specific table.

  --europe
      A synonym for '--dvb --default-charset ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy
      shortcut for commonly incorrect signalization on some European
      satellites. In that signalization, the character encoding is ISO-8859-15,
      the most common encoding for Latin & Western Europe languages. However,
      this is not the default DVB character set and it should be properly
      specified in all strings, which is not the case with some operators.
      Using this option, all DVB strings without explicit table code are
      assumed to use ISO-8859-15 instead of the standard ISO-6937 encoding.

  --first-source
      Filter UDP packets based on the source address. Use the sender address of
      the first received packet as only allowed source. This option is useful
      when several sources send packets to the same destination address and
      port. Accepting all packets could result in a corrupted stream and only
      one sender shall be accepted. To allow a more precise selection of the
      sender, use option --source. Options --first-source and --source are
      mutually exclusive.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --ignore-crc32
      Do not check CRC32 of input sections. This can be used to analyze
      sections with incorrect CRC32 but otherwise correct.

  --ignore-leap-seconds
      Do not include explicit leap seconds in some UTC computations. Currently,
      this applies to SCTE 35 splice_schedule() commands only.

  --ip-udp [[source@]address:]port
      The [address:]port describes the destination of UDP packets to receive.
      The 'port' part is mandatory and specifies the UDP port to listen on. The
      'address' part is optional. It specifies an IP multicast address to
      listen on. It can be also a host name that translates to a multicast
      address. An optional source address can be specified as 'source@address:
      port' in the case of SSM.

  --irdeto
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x0600.

  --isdb
      Assume that the transport stream is an ISDB one. ISDB streams are
      normally automatically detected from their signalization. This option is
      only useful when ISDB-related stuff are found in the TS before the first
      ISDB-specific table.

  --japan
      A synonym for '--isdb --default-charset ARIB-STD-B24 --time-reference
      JST'. This is a handy shortcut when working on Japanese transport
      streams.

  --local-address ip-address
      Specify the IP address of the local interface on which to listen. It can
      be also a host name that translates to a local address. By default,
      listen on all local interfaces.

  -x value
  --max-tables value
      Maximum number of tables to dump. Stop logging tables when this limit is
      reached. Useful with --ip-udp which never ends otherwise.

  --mediaguard
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x0100.

  --nagravision
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x1800.

  --nds
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x0900.

  --nested-tlv[=min-size]
      With option --tlv, try to interpret the value field of each TLV record as
      another TLV area. If the min-size value is specified, the nested TLV
      interpretation is performed only on value fields larger than this size.
      The syntax of the nested TLV is the same as the enclosing TLV.

  --no-encapsulation
      With --ip-udp, receive the tables as raw binary messages in UDP packets.
      By default, the tables are formatted into TLV messages.

  --no-pager
      Do not send output through a pager process. By default, if the output
      device is a terminal, the output is paged.

  --no-reuse-port
      Disable the reuse port socket option. Do not use unless completely
      necessary.

  --philippines
      A synonym for '--isdb --abnt --default-charset RAW-UTF-8 --time-reference
      UTC+8'. This is a handy shortcut when working on Philippines transport
      streams.

  -r
  --raw-dump
      Raw dump of section, no interpretation.

  --receive-timeout milliseconds
      Specify the UDP reception timeout in milliseconds. This timeout applies
      to each receive operation, individually. By default, receive operations
      wait for data, possibly forever.

  --reuse-port
      Set the reuse port socket option. This is now enabled by default, the
      option is present for legacy only.

  --safeaccess
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x4ADC.

  --source ip-address[:port]
      Filter UDP packets based on the specified source address. This option is
      useful when several sources send packets to the same destination address
      and port. Accepting all packets could result in a corrupted stream and
      only one sender shall be accepted. Options --first-source and --source
      are mutually exclusive.

  --ssm
      Force the usage of Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) using the source which
      is specified by the option --source. The --ssm option is implicit when
      the syntax 'source@address:port' is used.

  --time-reference name
      Use a non-standard (non-UTC) time reference in TDT/TOT. This is typically
      used in ARIB ISDB and ABNT ISDB-Tb standards. The specified name can be
      either 'UTC', 'JST' (Japan Standard Time) or 'UTC+|-hh[:mm]'. Examples:
      'UTC+9' (same as 'JST' for ARIB ISDB), 'UTC-3' (for ABNT ISDB-Tb in
      Brazil).

  --tlv value
      For sections of unknown types, this option specifies how to interpret
      some parts of the section payload as TLV records. Several --tlv options
      are allowed, each one describes a part of the section payload.

      Each syntax string has the form "start,size,tagSize,lengthSize,order".
      The start and size fields define the offset and size of the TLV area in
      the section payload. If the size field is "auto", the TLV extends up to
      the end of the section. If the start field is "auto", the longest TLV
      area in the section payload will be used. The fields tagSize and
      lengthSize indicate the size in bytes of the Tag and Length fields in the
      TLV structure. The field order must be either "msb" or "lsb" and
      indicates the byte order of the Tag and Length fields.

      All fields are optional. The default values are "auto,auto,1,1,msb".

  --usa
      A synonym for '--atsc'. This is a handy shortcut when working on North
      American transport streams.

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version[=name]
      Display the TSDuck version number.
      The 'name' must be one of "acceleration", "all", "bitrate", "compiler",
      "crypto", "date", "dektec", "http", "integer", "long", "nsis", "rist",
      "short", "srt", "system", "vatek".

  --viaccess
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x0500.

  --widevine
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x4AD4.
