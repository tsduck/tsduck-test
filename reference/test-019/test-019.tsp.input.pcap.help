Read TS packets from a pcap or pcap-ng file

Usage: tsp -I pcap [options] [file-name]

Parameter:

  The name of a '.pcap' or '.pcapng' capture file as produced by Wireshark for
  instance. This input plugin extracts IPv4 UDP datagrams which contain
  transport stream packets. Use the standard input by default, when no file
  name is specified.

Options:

  -d [ip-address]:[port]
  --destination [ip-address]:[port]
      Filter UDP datagrams based on the specified destination socket address.
      By default or if either the IP address or UDP port is missing, use the
      destination of the first matching UDP datagram containing TS packets.
      Then, select only UDP datagrams with this socket address.

  --emmg-client-id value
      With --tcp-emmg-mux or --udp-emmg-mux, select the EMMG<=>MUX client_id to
      extract. By default, use all client ids.

  --emmg-data-id value
      With --tcp-emmg-mux or --udp-emmg-mux, select the EMMG<=>MUX data_id to
      extract. By default, use all data ids.

  --first-date date-time
      Filter packets starting at the specified date. Use format YYYY/MM/DD:hh:
      mm:ss.mmm.

  --first-packet value
      Filter packets starting at the specified number. The packet numbering
      counts all captured packets from the beginning of the file, starting at
      1. This is the same value as seen on Wireshark in the leftmost column.

  --first-timestamp microseconds
      Filter packets starting at the specified timestamp in micro-seconds from
      the beginning of the capture. This is the same value as seen on Wireshark
      in the "Time" column (in seconds).

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -h
  --http
      Select a TCP stream in the pcap file using the HTTP protocol and extract
      TS packets from the response. The --source and --destination options
      define the TCP stream. If some address or port are undefined in these two
      options, the first TCP stream matching the specified portions is
      selected.

  --last-date date-time
      Filter packets up to the specified date. Use format YYYY/MM/DD:hh:mm:ss.
      mmm.

  --last-packet value
      Filter packets up to the specified number. The packet numbering counts
      all captured packets from the beginning of the file, starting at 1. This
      is the same value as seen on Wireshark in the leftmost column.

  --last-timestamp microseconds
      Filter packets up to the specified timestamp in micro-seconds from the
      beginning of the capture. This is the same value as seen on Wireshark in
      the "Time" column (in seconds).

  -m
  --multicast-only
      When there is no --destination option, select the first multicast address
      which is found in a UDP datagram. By default, use the destination address
      of the first UDP datagram containing TS packets, unicast or multicast.

  --rs204
      Specify that all packets are in 204-byte format. By default, the input
      packet size, 188 or 204 bytes, is automatically detected. Use this option
      only when necessary.

  -s [ip-address]:[port]
  --source [ip-address]:[port]
      Filter UDP datagrams based on the specified source socket address. By
      default, do not filter on source address.

  --tcp-emmg-mux
      Select a TCP stream in the pcap file using the DVB SimulCrypt EMMG/PDG
      <=> MUX protocol. The transport stream is made of the TS packets from the
      'data_provision' messages (the session must have been set in packet mode,
      not in section mode). This option is typically used to extract EMM PID's
      as produced by a standard EMMG which feeds a MUX. The --source and
      --destination options define the TCP stream. If some address or port are
      undefined in these two options, the first TCP stream matching the
      specified portions is selected.

  --timestamp-priority name
      Specify how the input timestamp of each packet is computed. The name
      specifies an ordered list. The first available timestamp value is used as
      input timestamp. The possible timestamp sources are:
      - rtp : The RTP time stamp, when the UDP packet is an RTP packet.
      - pcap : pcap capture time stamp.
      - tsp : A software timestamp, provided by tsp when the input plugin
      returns a chunk of packets.
      The tsp-provided timestamp is always available, always comes last and is
      less precise. The default is rtp-pcap-tsp.
      The 'name' must be one of "pcap-rtp-tsp", "pcap-tsp", "rtp-pcap-tsp",
      "rtp-tsp", "tsp".

  --udp-emmg-mux
      Consider each selected UDP datagram as containing a 'data_provision'
      message as defined by the DVB SimulCrypt EMMG/PDG <=> MUX protocol. The
      transport stream is made of the TS packets from these 'data_provision'
      messages (the session must have been set in packet mode, not in section
      mode). This option is typically used to extract EMM PID's as produced by
      a standard EMMG which feeds a MUX. By default, the UDP datagrams contain
      raw TS packets, with or without RTP headers.

  --vlan-id value
      Filter packets from the specified VLAN id. This option can be specified
      multiple times. In that case, the values define nested VLAN ids, from the
      outer to inner VLAN.
