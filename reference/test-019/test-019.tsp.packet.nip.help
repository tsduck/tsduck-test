DVB-NIP (Native IP) analyzer

Usage: tsp -P nip [options]

Options:

  --dump-flute-payload
      Same as --log-flute-packets and also dump the payload of each FLUTE
      packet.

  --dump-xml-files
      Dump the content of XML files when they are received.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --log-fdt
      Log a message describing each FLUTE File Delivery Table (FDT).

  --log-files
      Log a message describing each received file.

  --log-flute-packets
      Log a message describing the structure of each FLUTE packet.

  --max-file-size value
      Maximum size of files to analyze or extract. Each received file is
      accumulated in memory, chunk by chunk, until the file is complete. After
      processing the file, all chunks are freeed. This option is useful when
      the stream contains many large files which clutter the memory during
      their reception. All files which are announced as larger than the
      specified size are ignored. By default, all files are received and
      analyzed or saved.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  -p value
  --pid value
      Specify the MPE PID containing the DVB-NIP stream. By default, if neither
      --pid nor --service is specified, use the first MPE PID which is found.
      Options --pid and --service are mutually exclusive.

  --save-bootstrap file-name
      Save the bootstrap multicast gateway configuration in the specified file.
      This is a XML file. If the specified path is '-', the file is written to
      standard output.

  --save-dvb-gw directory-name
      Save all files in the DVB-NIP carousel with URI starting with http://dvb.
      gw/. The specified path is a directory. The file hierarchy is recreated
      from this directory. Example: with '--save-dvb-gw /save/to', the file
      http://dvb.gw/operator.com/materials/f.jpg is saved as /save/to/operator.
      com/materials/f.jpg.

  --save-fdt file-name
      Save each FLUTE File Delivery Table (FDT) in a file. Each FDT instance is
      saved in a separate file. If the specified path is 'dir/fdt.xml' for
      instance, the FDT with instance N is saved in file 'dir/fdt-N.xml'. If
      the specified path is '-', the file is written to standard output.

  --save-nif file-name
      Save the DVB-NIP Network Information File (NIF) in the specified file.
      This is a XML file. If the specified path is '-', the file is written to
      standard output.

  --save-sif file-name
      Save the DVB-NIP Service Information File (SIF) in the specified file.
      This is a XML file. If the specified path is '-', the file is written to
      standard output.

  --save-slep file-name
      Save the DVB-I Service List Entry Points (SLEP) in the specified file.
      This is a XML file. If the specified path is '-', the file is written to
      standard output.

  -s name-or-id
  --service name-or-id
      Specify the service containing the DVB-NIP stream in a MPE PID. If the
      argument is an integer value (either decimal or hexadecimal), it is
      interpreted as a service id. Otherwise, it is interpreted as a service
      name, as specified in the SDT. The name is not case sensitive and blanks
      are ignored. By default, if neither --pid nor --service is specified, use
      the first MPE PID which is found.Options --pid and --service are mutually
      exclusive.

  --summary
      Display a summary of the DVB-NIP session. This is the default if no other
      option is specified.
