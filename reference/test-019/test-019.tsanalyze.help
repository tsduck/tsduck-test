Analyze the structure of a transport stream

Usage: tsanalyze [options] [filename]

Parameter:

  Input transport stream file (standard input if omitted).

Options:

  --abnt
      Assume that the transport stream is an ISDB one with ABNT-defined
      variants. ISDB streams are normally automatically detected from their
      signalization but there is no way to determine if this is an original
      ARIB-defined ISDB or an ABNT-defined variant.

  --atsc
      Assume that the transport stream is an ATSC one. ATSC streams are
      normally automatically detected from their signalization. This option is
      only useful when ATSC-related stuff are found in the TS before the first
      ATSC-specific table. For instance, when a PMT with ATSC-specific
      descriptors is found before the first ATSC MGT or VCT.

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      Specifies the bitrate of the transport stream in bits/second (based on
      188-byte packets). By default, the bitrate is evaluated using the PCR in
      the transport stream.
      The value must be a 64-bit floating-point value.

  --brazil
      A synonym for '--isdb --abnt --default-charset RAW-ISO-8859-15
      --time-reference UTC-3'. This is a handy shortcut when working on South
      American ISDB-Tb transport streams.

  -d[level]
  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting strings from tables and
      descriptors. By default, DVB encoding using ISO-6937 as default table is
      used. The available table names are ARIB, ARIB-STD-B24, DUMP, DVB,
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6,
      ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, RAW-ISO-6937, RAW-ISO-8859-1,
      RAW-ISO-8859-10, RAW-ISO-8859-11, RAW-ISO-8859-13, RAW-ISO-8859-14,
      RAW-ISO-8859-15, RAW-ISO-8859-2, RAW-ISO-8859-3, RAW-ISO-8859-4,
      RAW-ISO-8859-5, RAW-ISO-8859-6, RAW-ISO-8859-7, RAW-ISO-8859-8,
      RAW-ISO-8859-9, RAW-UNICODE, RAW-UTF-8, UNICODE, UTF-8.

  --default-pds value
      Default private data specifier. This option is meaningful only when the
      signalization is incorrect, when DVB private descriptors appear in tables
      without a preceding private_data_specifier_descriptor. The specified
      value is used as private data specifier to interpret DVB private
      descriptors. The PDS value can be an integer or one of (not
      case-sensitive) names.
      The 'value' must be one of "AOM", "Australia", "AVSA", "AVSV", "BskyB",
      "CanalPlus", "cuvv", "EACEM", "EICTA", "Eutelsat", "Logiways", "Nagra",
      "NorDig", "OFCOM", "TPS".

  --default-registration value
      Default registration id. This option is meaningful only when the
      signalization is incorrect, when MPEG private descriptors appear in
      tables without a preceding registration_descriptor. The specified value
      is used as registration id (also know as format identifier) to interpret
      MPEG private descriptors or stream types.
      Several options --default-registration can be specified. Unlike DVB
      private data specifiers, several MPEG registration ids can be
      simultaneously defined.

  --deterministic
      Enforce a deterministic and reproduceable output. Do not output
      non-reproduceable information such as system time (useful for automated
      tests).

  --dvb
      Assume that the transport stream is a DVB one. DVB streams are normally
      automatically detected from their signalization. This option is only
      useful when possibly incorrect non-DVB stuff are found in the TS before
      the first DVB-specific table.

  --error-analysis
      Report analysis about detected errors.

  --europe
      A synonym for '--dvb --default-charset ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy
      shortcut for commonly incorrect signalization on some European
      satellites. In that signalization, the character encoding is ISO-8859-15,
      the most common encoding for Latin & Western Europe languages. However,
      this is not the default DVB character set and it should be properly
      specified in all strings, which is not the case with some operators.
      Using this option, all DVB strings without explicit table code are
      assumed to use ISO-8859-15 instead of the standard ISO-6937 encoding.

  --format name
      Specify the format of the input TS file. By default, the format is
      automatically detected. But the auto-detection may fail in some cases
      (for instance when the first time-stamp of an M2TS file starts with
      0x47). Using this option forces a specific format.
      The 'name' must be one of "autodetect", "duck", "M2TS", "RS204", "TS".

  --global-pid-list
      Report the list of all global PID's, that is to say PID's which are not
      referenced by a specific service but are or are referenced by the
      standard DVB PSI/SI. This include, for instance, PID's of the PAT, EMM's,
      EIT's, stuffing, etc.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --ignore-leap-seconds
      Do not include explicit leap seconds in some UTC computations. Currently,
      this applies to SCTE 35 splice_schedule() commands only.

  --isdb
      Assume that the transport stream is an ISDB one. ISDB streams are
      normally automatically detected from their signalization. This option is
      only useful when ISDB-related stuff are found in the TS before the first
      ISDB-specific table.

  --japan
      A synonym for '--isdb --default-charset ARIB-STD-B24 --time-reference
      JST'. This is a handy shortcut when working on Japanese transport
      streams.

  --json
      Complete report about the transport stream, the services and the PID's in
      JSON format.

  --json-buffer-size value
      With --json-tcp or --json-udp, specify the network socket send buffer
      size in bytes.

  --json-line[='prefix']
      Complete report about the transport stream, the services and the PID's in
      JSON format. Report the JSON text as one single line in the message
      logger. The optional string parameter specifies a prefix to prepend on
      the log line before the JSON text to locate the appropriate line in the
      logs.

  --json-tcp ip-address:port
      Complete report about the transport stream, the services and the PID's in
      JSON format. Report the JSON text as one single line in a TCP connection.
      The address specifies an IP address or a host name that translates to an
      IP address. The port specifies the destination TCP port. By default, a
      new TCP connection is established each time a JSON message is produced.
      Be aware that a complete TCP connection cycle may introduce some latency
      in the processing. If latency is an issue, consider using --json-udp.

  --json-tcp-keep
      With --json-tcp, keep the TCP connection open for all JSON messages. By
      default, a new TCP connection is established each time a JSON message is
      produced.

  --json-udp ip-address:port
      Complete report about the transport stream, the services and the PID's in
      JSON format. Report the JSON text as one single line in a UDP datagram.
      The address specifies an IP address which can be either unicast or
      multicast. It can be also a host name that translates to an IP address.
      The port specifies the destination UDP port. Be aware that the size of
      UDP datagrams is limited by design to 64 kB. If larger JSON contents are
      expected, consider using --json-tcp.

  --json-udp-local ip-address
      With --json-udp, when the destination is a multicast address, specify the
      IP address of the outgoing local interface. It can be also a host name
      that translates to a local address.

  --json-udp-ttl value
      With --json-udp, specifies the TTL (Time-To-Live) socket option. The
      actual option is either "Unicast TTL" or "Multicast TTL", depending on
      the destination address. Remember that the default Multicast TTL is 1 on
      most systems.

  --no-pager
      Do not send output through a pager process. By default, if the output
      device is a terminal, the output is paged.

  --normalized
      Complete report about the transport stream, the services and the PID's in
      a normalized output format (useful for automatic analysis).

  --pes-pid-list
      Report the list of all PID's which are declared as carrying PES packets
      (audio, video, subtitles, etc).

  --philippines
      A synonym for '--isdb --abnt --default-charset RAW-UTF-8 --time-reference
      UTC+8'. This is a handy shortcut when working on Philippines transport
      streams.

  --pid-analysis
      Report analysis for each PID.

  --pid-list
      Report the list of all PID's.

  --prefix value
      For one-line displays (options --*-list), prepend the specified string to
      all values. For instance, options --global --prefix -p outputs something
      like '-p 0 -p 1 -p 16', which is an acceptable option list for the tsp
      filter plugin.

  --service-analysis
      Report analysis for each service.

  --service-list
      Report the list of all service ids.

  --service-pid-list value
      Report the list of all PID's which are referenced by the specified
      service id.

  --suspect-max-consecutive value
      Specifies the maximum number of consecutive "suspect" packets. The
      default value is 1. If set to zero, the suspect packet detection is
      disabled.

      Suspect packets are TS packets which are technically correct but which
      may be suspected of being incorrect, resulting in analysis errors.
      Typically, in the middle of a suite of packets with uncorrectable binary
      errors, one packet may appear to have no such error while it has some
      errors in fact. To avoid adding this type of packets in the analysis, a
      packet is declared as "suspect" (and consequently ignored in the
      analysis) when:
      - its PID is unknown (no other packet was found in this PID)
      - it immediately follows a certain amount of packet containing errors
      (see option --suspect-min-error-count)
      - it immediately follows no more than the specified number consecutive
      suspect packets.

  --suspect-min-error-count value
      Specifies the minimum number of consecutive packets with errors before
      starting "suspect" packet detection. See also option
      --suspect-max-consecutive. The default value is 1. If set to zero, the
      suspect packet detection is disabled.

  --table-analysis
      Report analysis for each table.

  --time-reference name
      Use a non-standard (non-UTC) time reference in TDT/TOT. This is typically
      used in ARIB ISDB and ABNT ISDB-Tb standards. The specified name can be
      either 'UTC', 'JST' (Japan Standard Time) or 'UTC+|-hh[:mm]'. Examples:
      'UTC+9' (same as 'JST' for ARIB ISDB), 'UTC-3' (for ABNT ISDB-Tb in
      Brazil).

  --title value
      Display the specified string as title header.

  --ts-analysis
      Report global transport stream analysis.

      The output can include full synthetic analysis (options *-analysis),
      fully normalized output (options --normalized and --json) or a simple
      list of values on one line (options --*-list). The second and third type
      of options are useful to write automated scripts.

      If output-control options are specified, only the selected outputs are
      produced. If no option is given, the default is: --ts-analysis
      --service-analysis --pid-analysis --table-analysis

  --unreferenced-pid-list
      Report the list of all unreferenced PID's, that is to say PID's which are
      neither referenced by a service nor known as or referenced by the
      standard DVB PSI/SI.

  --usa
      A synonym for '--atsc'. This is a handy shortcut when working on North
      American transport streams.

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version[=name]
      Display the TSDuck version number.
      The 'name' must be one of "acceleration", "all", "bitrate", "compiler",
      "crypto", "date", "dektec", "http", "integer", "long", "nsis", "rist",
      "short", "srt", "system", "vatek".

  -w
  --wide-display
      Use a wider grid display with more information on each line.
