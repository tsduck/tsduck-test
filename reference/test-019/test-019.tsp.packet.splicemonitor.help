Monitor SCTE 35 splice information

Usage: tsp -P splicemonitor [options]

Options:

  --alarm-command 'command'
      Command to run when a splice event is outside the nominal range as
      specified by other --min and --max options. The command receives seven
      additional parameters:

      1. A human-readable message, the same as logged by the plugin.
      2. The PID of the splice command.
      3. The event id.
      4. The string "in" or "out" for splice in / splice out command.
      5. The adjusted PTS value in the splice command.
      6. Pre-roll time in milliseconds.
      7. Number of occurences of the command before the event.

  -a
  --all-commands
      Same as --display-commands but display all SCTE-35 splice information
      commands. This is equivalent to --select-commands 0-255. By default, only
      display splice insert commands.

  -d
  --display-commands
      Display the content of SCTE-35 splice insert commands. By default, only
      log a short event description.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -j
  --json
      Build a JSON description of splice events.

  --json-buffer-size value
      With --json-tcp or --json-udp, specify the network socket send buffer
      size in bytes.

  --json-line[='prefix']
      Build a JSON description of splice events. Report the JSON text as one
      single line in the message logger. The optional string parameter
      specifies a prefix to prepend on the log line before the JSON text to
      locate the appropriate line in the logs.

  --json-tcp ip-address:port
      Build a JSON description of splice events. Report the JSON text as one
      single line in a TCP connection. The address specifies an IP address or a
      host name that translates to an IP address. The port specifies the
      destination TCP port. By default, a new TCP connection is established
      each time a JSON message is produced. Be aware that a complete TCP
      connection cycle may introduce some latency in the processing. If latency
      is an issue, consider using --json-udp.

  --json-tcp-keep
      With --json-tcp, keep the TCP connection open for all JSON messages. By
      default, a new TCP connection is established each time a JSON message is
      produced.

  --json-udp ip-address:port
      Build a JSON description of splice events. Report the JSON text as one
      single line in a UDP datagram. The address specifies an IP address which
      can be either unicast or multicast. It can be also a host name that
      translates to an IP address. The port specifies the destination UDP port.
      Be aware that the size of UDP datagrams is limited by design to 64 kB. If
      larger JSON contents are expected, consider using --json-tcp.

  --json-udp-local ip-address
      With --json-udp, when the destination is a multicast address, specify the
      IP address of the outgoing local interface. It can be also a host name
      that translates to a local address.

  --json-udp-ttl value
      With --json-udp, specifies the TTL (Time-To-Live) socket option. The
      actual option is either "Unicast TTL" or "Multicast TTL", depending on
      the destination address. Remember that the default Multicast TTL is 1 on
      most systems.

  --max-pre-roll-time milliseconds
      Specify a maximum pre-roll time in milliseconds for splice commands. See
      option --alarm-command for non-nominal cases.

  --max-repetition value
      Specify a maximum number of repetitions for each splice command. See
      option --alarm-command for non-nominal cases.

  --meta-sections
      Add hexadecimal dump of each section in XML and JSON metadata.

  --min-pre-roll-time milliseconds
      Specify a minimum pre-roll time in milliseconds for splice commands. See
      option --alarm-command for non-nominal cases.

  --min-repetition value
      Specify a minimum number of repetitions for each splice command. See
      option --alarm-command for non-nominal cases.

  -n
  --no-adjustment
      When computing the anticipated pre-roll time at reception of a splice
      command, do not try to adjust the time using the distance between the
      last PTS and the splice command. By default, use the bitrate to adjust
      the supposed PTS of the splice command itself.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  -o file-name
  --output-file file-name
      Specify an output text file. With --json, this will be a JSON file. By
      default, use the message logging system (or standard output with
      --display-commands).

  -i
  --packet-index
      Display the current TS packet index for each message or event.

  --select-commands value1[-value2]
      Same as --display-commands but display the specified SCTE-35 command
      types only. By default, only display splice insert commands. Several
      --select-commands can be specified.

  -s value
  --splice-pid value
      Specify one PID carrying SCTE-35 sections to monitor. By default, all
      SCTE-35 PID's are monitored.

  --tag 'string'
      Leading tag to be displayed with each message. Useful when the plugin is
      used several times in the same process.

  -t value
  --time-pid value
      Specify one video or audio PID containing PTS time stamps to link with
      SCTE-35 sections to monitor. By default, the PMT's are used to link
      between PTS PID's and SCTE-35 PID's.

  --timestamp
      Add a time stamp (current local time) inside each JSON structure (tables
      and events).
