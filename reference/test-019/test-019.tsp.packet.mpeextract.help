Options:

  -d ip-address:port
  --destination ip-address:port
      IP address and UDP port of the stream to extract. If --destination is not
      specified, extract the first destination socket address that is found in
      the selected MPE PID.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

      packet processing plugins.

  -p value
  --pid value
      Specify the MPE PID containing the UDP transport stream. By default, if
      neither --pid nor --service is specified, use the first MPE PID which is
      found.Options --pid and --service are mutually exclusive.

  -s name-or-id
  --service name-or-id
      Specify the service containing the UDP transport stream in a MPE PID. If
      the argument is an integer value (either decimal or hexadecimal), it is
      interpreted as a service id. Otherwise, it is interpreted as a service
      name, as specified in the SDT. The name is not case sensitive and blanks
      are ignored. By default, if neither --pid nor --service is specified, use
      the first MPE PID which is found.Options --pid and --service are mutually
      exclusive.
