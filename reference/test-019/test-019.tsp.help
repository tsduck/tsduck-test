MPEG transport stream processor using a chain of plugins

Usage: tsp [tsp-options] \
    [-I input-name [input-options]] \
    [-P processor-name [processor-options]] ... \
    [-O output-name [output-options]]

Options:

  --abnt
      Assume that the transport stream is an ISDB one with ABNT-defined
      variants. ISDB streams are normally automatically detected from their
      signalization but there is no way to determine if this is an original
      ARIB-defined ISDB or an ABNT-defined variant.

  -a nullpkt/inpkt
  --add-input-stuffing nullpkt/inpkt
      Specify that <nullpkt> null TS packets must be automatically inserted
      after every <inpkt> input TS packets. Both <nullpkt> and <inpkt> must be
      non-zero integer values. This option is useful to artificially increase
      the input bitrate by adding stuffing. Example: the option "-a 14/24" adds
      14 null packets every 24 input packets, effectively turning a 24 Mb/s
      input stream (terrestrial) into a 38 Mb/s stream (satellite).

  --add-start-stuffing count
      Specify that <count> null TS packets must be automatically inserted at
      the start of the processing, before what comes from the input plugin.

  --add-stop-stuffing count
      Specify that <count> null TS packets must be automatically inserted at
      the end of the processing, after what comes from the input plugin.

  --atsc
      Assume that the transport stream is an ATSC one. ATSC streams are
      normally automatically detected from their signalization. This option is
      only useful when ATSC-related stuff are found in the TS before the first
      ATSC-specific table. For instance, when a PMT with ATSC-specific
      descriptors is found before the first ATSC MGT or VCT.

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      Specify the input bitrate, in bits/seconds. By default, the input bitrate
      is provided by the input plugin or by analysis of the PCR.
      The value must be a 64-bit floating-point value.

  --bitrate-adjust-interval seconds
      Specify the interval in seconds between bitrate adjustments, ie. when the
      output bitrate is adjusted to the input one. The default is 5 seconds.
      Some output processors ignore this setting. Typically, ASI or modulator
      devices use it, while file devices ignore it. This option is ignored if
      --bitrate is specified.

  --brazil
      A synonym for '--isdb --abnt --default-charset RAW-ISO-8859-15
      --hf-band-region brazil --time-reference UTC-3'. This is a handy shortcut
      when working on South American ISDB-Tb transport streams.

  --buffer-size-mb value
      Specify the buffer size in mega-bytes. This is the size of the buffer
      between the input and output devices. The default is 16 MB.
      The value may include up to 6 meaningful decimal digits.

  --conax
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x0B00.

  --control-local ip-address
      Specify the IP address of the local interface on which to listen for
      control commands. It can be also a host name that translates to a local
      address. By default, listen on all local interfaces.

  --control-port value
      Specify the TCP port on which tsp listens for control commands. If
      unspecified, no control commands are expected.

  --control-reuse-port
      Set the 'reuse port' socket option on the control TCP server port. This
      option is not enabled by default to avoid accidentally running two tsp
      commands with the same control port.

  --control-source ip-address
      Specify a remote IP address which is allowed to send control commands. By
      default, as a security precaution, only the local host is allowed to
      connect. Several --control-source options are allowed.

  --control-timeout milliseconds
      Specify the reception timeout for control commands. The default timeout
      is 5,000 ms.

  -d[level]
  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  --default-cas-id value
      Interpret all EMM's and ECM's from unknown CAS as coming from the
      specified CA_System_Id. By default, EMM's and ECM's are interpreted
      according to the CA_descriptor which references their PID. This option is
      useful when analyzing partial transport streams without CAT or PMT to
      correctly identify the CA PID's.

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting strings from tables and
      descriptors. By default, DVB encoding using ISO-6937 as default table is
      used. The available table names are ARIB, ARIB-STD-B24, DUMP, DVB,
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6,
      ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, RAW-ISO-6937, RAW-ISO-8859-1,
      RAW-ISO-8859-10, RAW-ISO-8859-11, RAW-ISO-8859-13, RAW-ISO-8859-14,
      RAW-ISO-8859-15, RAW-ISO-8859-2, RAW-ISO-8859-3, RAW-ISO-8859-4,
      RAW-ISO-8859-5, RAW-ISO-8859-6, RAW-ISO-8859-7, RAW-ISO-8859-8,
      RAW-ISO-8859-9, RAW-UNICODE, RAW-UTF-8, UNICODE, UTF-8.

  --default-pds value
      Default private data specifier. This option is meaningful only when the
      signalization is incorrect, when DVB private descriptors appear in tables
      without a preceding private_data_specifier_descriptor. The specified
      value is used as private data specifier to interpret DVB private
      descriptors. The PDS value can be an integer or one of (not
      case-sensitive) names.
      The 'value' must be one of "AOM", "Australia", "AVSA", "AVSV", "BskyB",
      "CanalPlus", "cuvv", "EACEM", "EICTA", "Eutelsat", "Logiways", "Nagra",
      "NorDig", "OFCOM", "TPS".

  --default-registration value
      Default registration id. This option is meaningful only when the
      signalization is incorrect, when MPEG private descriptors appear in
      tables without a preceding registration_descriptor. The specified value
      is used as registration id (also know as format identifier) to interpret
      MPEG private descriptors or stream types.
      Several options --default-registration can be specified. Unlike DVB
      private data specifiers, several MPEG registration ids can be
      simultaneously defined.

  --dvb
      Assume that the transport stream is a DVB one. DVB streams are normally
      automatically detected from their signalization. This option is only
      useful when possibly incorrect non-DVB stuff are found in the TS before
      the first DVB-specific table.

  --europe
      A synonym for '--dvb --default-charset ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy
      shortcut for commonly incorrect signalization on some European
      satellites. In that signalization, the character encoding is ISO-8859-15,
      the most common encoding for Latin & Western Europe languages. However,
      this is not the default DVB character set and it should be properly
      specified in all strings, which is not the case with some operators.
      Using this option, all DVB strings without explicit table code are
      assumed to use ISO-8859-15 instead of the standard ISO-6937 encoding.

  --final-wait milliseconds
      Wait the specified duration after the last input packet. Zero means wait
      forever.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --hf-band-region name
      Specify the region for UHF/VHF band frequency layout. The available
      regions are abnt, argentina, botswana, brazil, chile, ecuador, europe,
      france, japan, korea, north-america, paraguay, philippines,
      south-america, taiwan, uk, us, usa.

  -i
  --ignore-joint-termination
      Ignore all --joint-termination options in plugins. The idea behind "joint
      termination" is to terminate tsp when several plugins have jointly
      terminated their processing. Some plugins have a --joint-termination
      option. When set, the plugin executes until some plugin-specific
      condition. When all plugins with --joint-termination set have reached
      their termination condition, tsp terminates.

      The option --ignore-joint-termination disables the termination of tsp
      when all plugins have reached their joint termination condition.

  --ignore-leap-seconds
      Do not include explicit leap seconds in some UTC computations. Currently,
      this applies to SCTE 35 splice_schedule() commands only.

  --initial-input-packets value
      Specify the number of packets to initially read in the buffer before
      starting the processing. The initial load is used to evaluate the bitrate
      so that all subsequent plugins can have a valid bitrate value from the
      beginning. The default initial load is half the size of the global
      buffer.

  --irdeto
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x0600.

  --isdb
      Assume that the transport stream is an ISDB one. ISDB streams are
      normally automatically detected from their signalization. This option is
      only useful when ISDB-related stuff are found in the TS before the first
      ISDB-specific table.

  --japan
      A synonym for '--isdb --default-charset ARIB-STD-B24 --hf-band-region
      japan --time-reference JST'. This is a handy shortcut when working on
      Japanese transport streams.

  -l[value]
  --list-plugins[=value]
      List all available plugins.
      The 'value' must be one of "all", "input", "names-input", "names-output",
      "names-packet", "output", "packet".

  --log-message-count value
      Specify the maximum number of buffered log messages. Log messages are
      displayed asynchronously in a low priority thread. This value specifies
      the maximum number of buffered log messages in memory, before being
      displayed. When too many messages are logged in a short period of time,
      while plugins use all CPU power, extra messages are dropped. Increase
      this value if you think that too many messages are dropped. The default
      is 512 messages.

  --log-plugin-index
      In log messages, add the plugin index to the plugin name. This can be
      useful if the same plugin is used several times and all instances log
      many messages.

  --max-flushed-packets value
      Specify the maximum number of packets to be processed before flushing
      them to the next processor or the output. When the processing time is
      high and some packets are lost, try decreasing this value. The default is
      10,000 packets in offline mode and 1,000 in real-time mode.

  --max-input-packets value
      Specify the maximum number of packets to be received at a time from the
      input plug-in. By default, in offline mode, tsp reads as many packets as
      it can, depending on the free space in the buffer. In real-time mode, the
      default is 1,000 packets.

  --max-output-packets value
      Specify the maximum number of packets to be sent at a time by the output
      plugin. By default, tsp sends as many packets as available. This option
      is useful only when an output plugin or device has problems with large
      output requests. This option forces multiple smaller send operations.

  --mediaguard
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x0100.

  -m[filename]
  --monitor[=filename]
      Continuously monitor the system resources which are used by tsp. This
      includes CPU load, virtual memory usage. Useful to verify the stability
      of the application. The optional file is an XML monitoring configuration
      file.

  --nagravision
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x1800.

  --nds
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x0900.

  --philippines
      A synonym for '--isdb --abnt --default-charset RAW-UTF-8 --hf-band-region
      philippines --time-reference UTC+8'. This is a handy shortcut when
      working on Philippines transport streams.

  -r[value]
  --realtime[=value]
      Specifies if tsp and all plugins should use default values for real-time
      or offline processing. By default, if any plugin prefers real-time, the
      real-time defaults are used. If no plugin prefers real-time, the offline
      default are used. If -r or --realtime is used alone, the real-time
      defaults are enforced. The explicit values 'no', 'false', 'off' are used
      to enforce the offline defaults and the explicit values 'yes', 'true',
      'on' are used to enforce the real-time defaults.

  --receive-timeout milliseconds
      Specify a timeout for all input operations. Equivalent to the same
      --receive-timeout options in some plugins. By default, there is no input
      timeout.

  --safeaccess
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x4ADC.

  -s
  --synchronous-log
      Each logged message is guaranteed to be displayed, synchronously, without
      any loss of message. The downside is that a plugin thread may be blocked
      for a short while when too many messages are logged. This option shall be
      used when all log messages are needed and the source and destination are
      not live streams (files for instance). This option is not recommended for
      live streams, when the responsiveness of the application is more
      important than the logged messages.

  --time-reference name
      Use a non-standard (non-UTC) time reference in TDT/TOT. This is typically
      used in ARIB ISDB and ABNT ISDB-Tb standards. The specified name can be
      either 'UTC', 'JST' (Japan Standard Time) or 'UTC+|-hh[:mm]'. Examples:
      'UTC+9' (same as 'JST' for ARIB ISDB), 'UTC-3' (for ABNT ISDB-Tb in
      Brazil).

  -t
  --timed-log
      Each logged message contains a time stamp.

  --usa
      A synonym for '--atsc --hf-band-region usa'. This is a handy shortcut
      when working on North American transport streams.

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version[=name]
      Display the TSDuck version number.
      The 'name' must be one of "acceleration", "all", "bitrate", "compiler",
      "crypto", "date", "dektec", "http", "integer", "long", "nsis", "rist",
      "short", "srt", "system", "vatek".

  --viaccess
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x0500.

  --widevine
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x4AD4.
