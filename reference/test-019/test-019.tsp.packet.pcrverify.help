Verify PCR's from TS packets

Usage: tsp -P pcrverify [options]

Options:

  -a
  --absolute
      Use absolute values in PCR unit. By default, use micro-second equivalent
      values (one micro-second = 27 PCR units).

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      Verify the PCR's according to this transport bitrate. By default, use the
      input bitrate as reported by the input device.
      The value must be a 64-bit floating-point value.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --help

  -i
  --input-synchronous
      Verify the PCR's according to each packet input timestamp. This method is
      meaningful only with real-time input sources or if the input source can
      recreate reliable input timestamps (M2TS files for instance). With this
      option, the bitrate is ignored.

  -j value
  --jitter-max value
      Maximum allowed jitter. PCR's with a higher jitter are reported, others
      are ignored. If --absolute, the specified value is in PCR units,
      otherwise it is in micro-seconds. The default is 27,000 PCR units or 1,
      000 micro-seconds.

  --jitter-unreal value
      Maximum realistic jitter. Any jitter above this value is unrealistic and
      ignored (probably because of a PCR leap). If --absolute, the specified
      value is in PCR units, otherwise it is in micro-seconds. The default is
      270,000,000 PCR units or 10,000,000 micro-seconds (10 seconds).

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  -p pid1[-pid2]
  --pid pid1[-pid2]
      PID filter: select packets with these PID values. Several -p or --pid
      options may be specified. Without -p or --pid option, PCR's from all
      PID's are used.

  -t
  --time-stamp
      Display time of each event.
