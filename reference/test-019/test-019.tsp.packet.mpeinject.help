Inject an incoming UDP stream into MPE (Multi-Protocol Encapsulation)

Usage: tsp -P mpeinject [options] [address:]port ...

Parameters:

  The [address:]port describes the destination of UDP packets to receive. The
  'port' part is mandatory and specifies the UDP port to listen on. The
  'address' part is optional. It specifies an IP multicast address to listen
  on. It can be also a host name that translates to a multicast address. An
  optional source address can be specified as 'source@address:port' in the case
  of SSM.
  Several [address:]port parameters can be specified to receive multiple UDP
  streams. If distinct receivers use the same port, this may work or not,
  depending on the operating system.

Options:

  -b value
  --buffer-size value
      Specify the UDP socket receive buffer size (socket option).

  --default-interface
      Let the system find the appropriate local interface on which to listen.
      By default, listen on all local interfaces.

  -f
  --first-source
      Filter UDP packets based on the source address. Use the sender address of
      the first received packet as only allowed source. This option is useful
      when several sources send packets to the same destination address and
      port. Accepting all packets could result in a corrupted stream and only
      one sender shall be accepted. To allow a more precise selection of the
      sender, use option --source. Options --first-source and --source are
      mutually exclusive.

  --help

  -l address
  --local-address address
      Specify the IP address of the local interface on which to listen. It can
      be also a host name that translates to a local address. By default,
      listen on all local interfaces.
      If several [address:]port parameters are specified, several
      --local-address options can be specified, one for each receiver, in the
      same order. It there are less --local-address options than receivers, the
      last --local-address applies for all remaining receivers.

  --mac-address nn:nn:nn:nn:nn:nn
      Specify the default destination MAC address to set in MPE sections for
      unicast IP packets. The default is 00:00:00:00:00:00. For multicast IP
      packets, the MAC address is automatically computed.

  --max-queue value
      Specify the maximum number of queued UDP datagrams before their insertion
      into the MPE stream. The default is 32.

  --new-destination address[:port]
      Change the destination IP address and UDP port in MPE sections. If the
      port is not specified, the original destination port from the UDP
      datagram is used. By default, the destination address is not modified.
      If several [address:]port parameters are specified, several
      --new-destination options can be specified, one for each receiver, in the
      same order. It there are less --new-destination options than receivers,
      the last --new-destination applies for all remaining receivers.

  --new-source address[:port]
      Change the source IP address and UDP port in MPE sections. If the port is
      not specified, the original source port from the UDP datagram is used. By
      default, the source address is not modified.
      If several [address:]port parameters are specified, several --new-source
      options can be specified, one for each receiver, in the same order. It
      there are less --new-source options than receivers, the last --new-source
      applies for all remaining receivers.

  --no-reuse-port
      Disable the reuse port socket option. Do not use unless completely
      necessary.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  --pack-sections
      Specify to pack DSM-CC sections containing MPE datagrams. With this
      option, each DSM-CC section starts in the same TS packet as the previous
      section. By default, the last TS packet of a DSM-CC section is stuffed
      and the next section starts in the next TS packet of the PID.

  -p value
  --pid value
      Specify the PID into which the MPE datagrams shall be inserted. This is a
      mandatory parameter.

  --receive-timeout value
      Specify the UDP reception timeout in milliseconds. This timeout applies
      to each receive operation, individually. By default, receive operations
      wait for data, possibly forever.

  --replace
      Replace the target PID if it exists. By default, the plugin only replaces
      null packets and tsp stops with an error if incoming packets are found
      with the target PID.

  -r
  --reuse-port
      Set the reuse port socket option. This is now enabled by default, the
      option is present for legacy only.

  -s address[:port]
  --source address[:port]
      Filter UDP packets based on the specified source address. This option is
      useful when several sources send packets to the same destination address
      and port. Accepting all packets could result in a corrupted stream and
      only one sender shall be accepted. Options --first-source and --source
      are mutually exclusive.
      If several [address:]port parameters are specified, several --source
      options can be specified, one for each receiver, in the same order. It
      there are less --source options than receivers, the last --source applies
      for all remaining receivers.

  --ssm
      Force the usage of Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) using the source which
      is specified by the option --source. The --ssm option is implicit when
      the syntax 'source@address:port' is used.
