FLUTE analyzer

Usage: tsp -P flute [options]

Options:

  -d [ip-address]:[port]
  --destination [ip-address]:[port]
      Only use UDP packets with the specified destination IP address and/or UDP
      port. Multiple options --destination can be specified. By default, use
      all UDP packets.

  --dump-flute-payload
      Same as --log-flute-packets and also dump the payload of each FLUTE
      packet.

  --dump-xml-files
      Dump the content of XML files when they are received.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --extract-carousel directory-name
      Save all files in the FLUTE carousel. The specified path is a directory.
      The file hierarchy is recreated from this directory. When a FLUTE file
      name is an URI, the URI scheme is removed. The characters which are not
      allowed in file names are replaced with an underscore.

  --extract-destination [ip-address]:[port]
      With --extract-file, specify the destination IP address and/or UDP port
      of files. By default, extract the files with matching name and any IP
      destination.

  -e name-or-urn
  --extract-file name-or-urn
      Extract the specified file from the FLUTE carousel. The name-or-urn shall
      be the exact complete name of the file, as identified in the FDT. The
      option --extract-file can be specified several times. All files are
      extracted in the output directory which is specified in option
      --output-directory. The output base name of each file is the last part of
      the name-or-urn, after the last slash or colon.

  --extract-source ip-address
      With --extract-file, specify the source IP address of files. By default,
      extract the files with matching name and any IP source address.

  --extract-tsi value
      With --extract-file, specify the Transport Session Identifier (TSI) of
      files. By default, extract the files with matching name and any TSI.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --log-fdt
      Log a message describing each FLUTE File Delivery Table (FDT).

  --log-files
      Log a message describing each received file.

  --log-flute-packets
      Log a message describing the structure of each FLUTE packet.

  --max-file-size value
      Maximum size of files to analyze or extract. Each received file is
      accumulated in memory, chunk by chunk, until the file is complete. After
      processing the file, all chunks are freeed. This option is useful when
      the stream contains many large files which clutter the memory during
      their reception. All files which are announced as larger than the
      specified size are ignored. By default, all files are received and
      analyzed or saved.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  --output-directory directory-name
      Output directory for files which are extracted using option
      --extract-file. The default is the current directory.

  -o file-name
  --output-file file-name
      With --summary, save the report in the specified file. By default or if
      the specified path is '-', the report is written to standard output.

  -p value
  --pid value
      Specify the MPE PID containing the FLUTE stream. By default, if neither
      --pid nor --service is specified, use the first MPE PID which is found.
      Options --pid and --service are mutually exclusive.

  --save-fdt file-name
      Save each FLUTE File Delivery Table (FDT) in a file. Each FDT instance is
      saved in a separate file. If the specified path is 'dir/fdt.xml' for
      instance, the FDT with instance N is saved in file 'dir/fdt-N.xml'. If
      the specified path is '-', the file is written to standard output.

  -s name-or-id
  --service name-or-id
      Specify the service containing the FLUTE stream in a MPE PID. If the
      argument is an integer value (either decimal or hexadecimal), it is
      interpreted as a service id. Otherwise, it is interpreted as a service
      name, as specified in the SDT. The name is not case sensitive and blanks
      are ignored. By default, if neither --pid nor --service is specified, use
      the first MPE PID which is found.Options --pid and --service are mutually
      exclusive.

  --strict
      Apply a strict interpretation of protocols. By default, non-fatal
      misusages of the protocols are ignored.

  --summary
      Display a summary of the FLUTE sessions and files. This is the default if
      no other option is specified.
