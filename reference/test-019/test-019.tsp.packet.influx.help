Send live TS metrics to InfluxDB, a data source for Grafana

Usage: tsp -P influx [options]

Options:

  -c value
  --active-config value
      Config name to use in the InfluxDB CLI configurations file. By default,
      use the environment variable INFLUX_ACTIVE_CONFIG, then look for the
      active configuration in the configuration file, or the first
      configuration if none is marked as active.

  -a
  --all-pids
      Send bitrate monitoring data for all PID's. Equivalent to --pid 0-8191.

  -b name
  --bucket name
      Name of the InfluxDB bucket. By default, use the environment variable
      INFLUX_BUCKET_NAME.

  --bucket-id id
      Identifier of the InfluxDB bucket. The 'id' must be a 16-character value.
      By default, use the environment variable INFLUX_BUCKET_ID. Only one of
      --bucket and --bucket-id shall be specified.

  --configs-path file-name
      Path to the InfluxDB CLI configurations file. By default, use the
      environment variable INFLUX_CONFIGS_PATH, then $HOME/.influxdbv2/configs.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -h name
  --host-url name
      Host name or URL of the InfluxDB server. If a host name is used instead
      of a URL, http: is assumed. By default, use the environment variable
      INFLUX_HOST, then the InfluxDB CLI configuration file.

  -i seconds
  --interval seconds
      Interval in seconds between metrics reports to InfluxDB. The default is 5
      seconds.

  --local-time
      Transmit timestamps as local time, based on the current system
      configuration. By default, timestamps are transmitted as UTC time.

  --max-metrics count
      Stop after sending that number of metrics. This is a test option. Never
      stop by default.

  -n
  --names
      With --services, the services are identified in InfluxDB by their name,
      when available.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  -o name
  --org name
      Name of the InfluxDB organization. By default, use the environment
      variable INFLUX_ORG, then the InfluxDB CLI configuration file.

  --org-id id
      Identifier of the InfluxDB organization. The 'id' must be a 16-character
      value. By default, use the environment variable INFLUX_ORG_ID. Only one
      of --org and --org-id shall be specified.

  --pcr-based
      Use playout time based on PCR values. By default, the time is based on
      the wall-clock time (real time).

  -p pid1[-pid2]
  --pid pid1[-pid2]
      Send bitrate monitoring data for the specified PID's. The PID's are
      identified in InfluxDB by their value in decimal. Several -p or --pid
      options may be specified.

  --queue-size count
      Maximum number of queued metrics between the plugin thread and the
      communication thread with InfluxDB. With --pcr-based or
      --timestamp-based, on off-line streams which are processed at high speed,
      increase this value if some metrics are lost. The default queue size is
      10 messages.

  -s
  --services
      Send bitrate monitoring data for services. The services are identified in
      InfluxDB by their id in decimal.

  --start-time year/month/day:hour:minute:second
      With --pcr-based or --timestamp-based, specify the initial date & time
      reference. By default, with --pcr-based or --timestamp-based, the
      activity starts at the first UTC time which is found in a DVB TDT or ATSC
      STT.

  --timestamp-based
      Use playout time based on timestamp values from the input plugin. When
      input timestamps are not available or not monotonic, fallback to
      --pcr-based. By default, the time is based on the wall-clock time (real
      time).

  -t string
  --token string
      Token to authenticate InfluxDB requests. By default, use the environment
      variable INFLUX_TOKEN, then the InfluxDB CLI configuration file.

  --type
      Send bitrate monitoring for types of PID's. The types are identified in
      InfluxDB as "audio", "data", "ecm", "emm", "pcr", "psi", "stuffing",
      "subtitles", "undefined", "video".
