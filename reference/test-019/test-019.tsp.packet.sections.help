Remove, keep or merge sections from various PID's

Usage: tsp -P sections [options]

Options:

  -a
  --and
      Remove/keep a section when all conditions are true. By default, a section
      is removed/kept as soon as one condition is true.

  --etid id1[-id2]
      Remove/keep all sections with the corresponding "extended table id"
      values. The value is a combination of the table id and the table id
      extension. For example, the option -e 0x4A1234 removes/keeps all BAT
      sections (table id 0x4A) for bouquet id 0x1234 (table id extension).
      Several options --etid can be specified. See also option --reverse-etid.

  --help

  -k
  --keep
      Keep selected sections and remove others. The selection options are
      --tid, --etid, --version, etc. By default, when selection options are
      present, the selected sections are removed. If no selection option is
      present, the sections are simply merged from the various input PID's.

  -n
  --null-pid-reuse
      With this option, null packets can be replaced by packets for the output
      PID. By default, only packets from input PID's are replaced by output
      packets. This option may need to be used when --stuffing is specified and
      the input PID's contained packed sections. In that case, the output
      payload can be larger than the input and additional packets must be used.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  -o value
  --output-pid value
      Specifies the output PID. By default, the first input PID on the command
      line is used. If the output PID is different from all input PID's and
      this output PID already exists in the transport stream, an error is
      generated.

  --patch-xml file-name
      Specify an XML patch file which is applied to all sections on the fly.
      Here, the behavior of --patch-xml is slightly different, compared to
      other commands or plugins. While XML representation and patch normally
      apply to a complete table, they process one single section here. This
      means that the result of the patch must fit into one single section.
      Otherwise, only the first section of the result is kept (with the
      original section number of the input section). If the name starts with
      "<?xml", it is considered as "inline XML content". Several --patch-xml
      options can be specified. Patch files are sequentially applied on each
      section.

  -p pid1[-pid2]
  --pid pid1[-pid2]
      Specify input PID's. More than one input PID can be specified. All
      sections from all input PID's are merged into the output PID. At least
      one input PID must be specified.

  -r
  --reverse-etid
      With option --etid, reverse the table id and the table id extension parts
      in the "extended table id" values. With this option, the values in --etid
      are 0xEEEETT instead of 0xTTEEEE where 'TT' is the table id part and
      'EEEE' the table id extension part. This option can be useful when
      specifying ranges of values. For instance, the option '--etid
      0x4A1234-0x4A1250' removes/keeps BAT sections (table id 0x4A) for all
      service ids in the range 0x1234 to 0x1250. On the other hand, the options
      '--etid 0x12344E-0x12346F --reverse-etid' remove/keep all EIT sections
      (table ids 0x4E to 0x6F) for the service id 0x1234.

  --section-content hexa-data
      Remove/keep all sections the binary content of which starts with the
      specified binary data. The value must be a string of hexadecimal digits
      specifying any number of bytes. See also option --section-mask to specify
      selected bits or bytes only. Several options --section-content can be
      specified.

  --section-mask hexa-data
      With --section-content, specify a mask of meaningful bits in the binary
      data that must match the beginning of the section. The value must be a
      string of hexadecimal digits specifying any number of bytes. If omitted
      or shorter than the --section-content parameter, the mask is implicitely
      padded with FF bytes. If several options --section-content are specified,
      several options --section-mask can be specified. The first mask applies
      to the first content, the second mask to the second content, etc. If
      there are less masks than contents, the last mask is implicitly repeated.

  --section-number num1[-num2]
      Remove/keep all sections with the corresponding section number. Several
      options --section-number can be specified.

  -s
  --stuffing
      Insert stuffing at end of each section, up to the next TS packet
      boundary. By default, sections are packed and start in the middle of a TS
      packet, after the previous section. Note, however, that section headers
      are never scattered over a packet boundary.

  -t id1[-id2]
  --tid id1[-id2]
      Remove/keep all sections with the corresponding table id. Several options
      --tid can be specified.

  -e id1[-id2]
  --tid-ext id1[-id2]
      Remove/keep all sections with the corresponding table id extension.
      Several options --tid-ext can be specified.

  -v v1[-v2]
  --version v1[-v2]
      Remove/keep all sections with the corresponding versions. Several options
      --version can be specified.
