Analyze a DVB-NIP stream from a pcap or pcap-ng file

Usage: tsnip [options] [input-file]

Parameter:

  Input file in pcap or pcap-ng format, typically as saved by Wireshark. Use
  the standard input if no file name is specified.

Options:

  -d[level]
  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  --dump-flute-payload
      Same as --log-flute-packets and also dump the payload of each FLUTE
      packet.

  --first-date date-time
      Filter packets starting at the specified date. Use format YYYY/MM/DD:hh:
      mm:ss.mmm.

  --first-packet value
      Filter packets starting at the specified number. The packet numbering
      counts all captured packets from the beginning of the file, starting at
      1. This is the same value as seen on Wireshark in the leftmost column.

  --first-timestamp microseconds
      Filter packets starting at the specified timestamp in micro-seconds from
      the beginning of the capture. This is the same value as seen on Wireshark
      in the "Time" column (in seconds).

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --last-date date-time
      Filter packets up to the specified date. Use format YYYY/MM/DD:hh:mm:ss.
      mmm.

  --last-packet value
      Filter packets up to the specified number. The packet numbering counts
      all captured packets from the beginning of the file, starting at 1. This
      is the same value as seen on Wireshark in the leftmost column.

  --last-timestamp microseconds
      Filter packets up to the specified timestamp in micro-seconds from the
      beginning of the capture. This is the same value as seen on Wireshark in
      the "Time" column (in seconds).

  --log-fdt
      Log a message describing each FLUTE File Delivery Table (FDT).

  --log-flute-packets
      Log a message describing the structure of each FLUTE packet.

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version[=name]
      Display the TSDuck version number.
      The 'name' must be one of "acceleration", "all", "bitrate", "compiler",
      "crypto", "date", "dektec", "http", "integer", "long", "rist", "short",
      "srt", "system", "tls", "vatek", "zlib".

  --vlan-id value
      Filter packets from the specified VLAN id. This option can be specified
      multiple times. In that case, the values define nested VLAN ids, from the
      outer to inner VLAN.
