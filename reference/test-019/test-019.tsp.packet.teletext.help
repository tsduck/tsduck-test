Extract Teletext subtitles in SRT format

Usage: tsp -P teletext [options]

Options:

  --brazil
      A synonym for '--default-charset RAW-ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy
      shortcut when working on South American ISDB-Tb transport streams.

  -c
  --colors
      Add font color tags in the subtitles. By default, no color is specified.

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting strings from tables and
      descriptors. By default, DVB encoding using ISO-6937 as default table is
      used. The available table names are ARIB, ARIB-STD-B24, DUMP, DVB,
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6,
      ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, RAW-ISO-6937, RAW-ISO-8859-1,
      RAW-ISO-8859-10, RAW-ISO-8859-11, RAW-ISO-8859-13, RAW-ISO-8859-14,
      RAW-ISO-8859-15, RAW-ISO-8859-2, RAW-ISO-8859-3, RAW-ISO-8859-4,
      RAW-ISO-8859-5, RAW-ISO-8859-6, RAW-ISO-8859-7, RAW-ISO-8859-8,
      RAW-ISO-8859-9, RAW-UNICODE, RAW-UTF-8, UNICODE, UTF-8.

  --europe
      A synonym for '--default-charset ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy shortcut
      for commonly incorrect signalization on some European satellites. In that
      signalization, the character encoding is ISO-8859-15, the most common
      encoding for Latin & Western Europe languages. However, this is not the
      default DVB character set and it should be properly specified in all
      strings, which is not the case with some operators. Using this option,
      all DVB strings without explicit table code are assumed to use
      ISO-8859-15 instead of the standard ISO-6937 encoding.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --japan
      A synonym for '--default-charset ARIB-STD-B24'. This is a handy shortcut
      when working on Japanese transport streams.

  -l name
  --language name
      Specifies the language of the subtitles to select. This option is useful
      only with --service, when the PMT of the service declares Teletext
      subtitles in different languages.

  -m value
  --max-frames value
      Specifies the maximum number of Teletext frames to extract. The
      processing is then stopped. By default, all frames are extracted.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  -o filename
  --output-file filename
      Specifies the SRT output file name. This is a text file. By default, the
      SRT subtitles are displayed on the standard output.

  --page value
      Specifies the Teletext page to extract. This option is useful only when
      the Teletext PID contains several pages. By default, the first Teletext
      frame defines the page to use.

  --philippines
      A synonym for '--default-charset RAW-UTF-8'. This is a handy shortcut
      when working on Philippines transport streams.

  -p value
  --pid value
      Specifies the PID carrying Teletext subtitles. Alternatively, if the
      Teletext PID is properly signalled in the PMT of its service, the option
      --service can be used instead.

  -s value
  --service value
      Specifies the service with Teletext subtitles. If the argument is an
      integer value (either decimal or hexadecimal), it is interpreted as a
      service id. Otherwise, it is interpreted as a service name, as specified
      in the SDT. The name is not case sensitive and blanks are ignored. The
      first teletext_descriptor in the PMT of the service is used to identify
      the PID carrying Teletext subtitles. If neither --service nor --pid is
      specified, the first service in the PAT is used.
