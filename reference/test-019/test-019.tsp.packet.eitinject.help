Generate and inject EIT's in a transport stream

Usage: tsp -P eitinject [options]

Options:

  --actual
      Generate EIT actual. If neither --actual nor --other are specified, both
      are generated.

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      The maximum bitrate of the EIT PID. By default, the EIT sections are
      inserted as soon as possible, with respect to their individual cycle
      time.
      The value must be a 64-bit floating-point value.

  --brazil
      A synonym for '--default-charset RAW-ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy
      shortcut when working on South American ISDB-Tb transport streams.

  --cycle-pf-actual value
      Repetition cycle in seconds for EIT p/f actual. The default is 2 seconds.

  --cycle-pf-other value
      Repetition cycle in seconds for EIT p/f other. The default is 10 seconds.

  --cycle-schedule-actual-later value
      Repetition cycle in seconds for EIT schedule actual after the "prime"
      period. The default is 30 seconds. See options --prime-days.

  --cycle-schedule-actual-prime value
      Repetition cycle in seconds for EIT schedule actual in the "prime"
      period. The default is 10 seconds. See options --prime-days.

  --cycle-schedule-other-later value
      Repetition cycle in seconds for EIT schedule other after the "prime"
      period. The default is 30 seconds. See options --prime-days.

  --cycle-schedule-other-prime value
      Repetition cycle in seconds for EIT schedule other in the "prime" period.
      The default is 10 seconds. See options --prime-days.

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting strings from tables and
      descriptors. By default, DVB encoding using ISO-6937 as default table is
      used. The available table names are ARIB, ARIB-STD-B24, DUMP, DVB,
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6,
      ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, RAW-ISO-6937, RAW-ISO-8859-1,
      RAW-ISO-8859-10, RAW-ISO-8859-11, RAW-ISO-8859-13, RAW-ISO-8859-14,
      RAW-ISO-8859-15, RAW-ISO-8859-2, RAW-ISO-8859-3, RAW-ISO-8859-4,
      RAW-ISO-8859-5, RAW-ISO-8859-6, RAW-ISO-8859-7, RAW-ISO-8859-8,
      RAW-ISO-8859-9, RAW-UNICODE, RAW-UTF-8, UNICODE, UTF-8.

  -d
  --delete-files
      Specifies that the event input files should be deleted after being
      loaded. By default, the files are left unmodified after being loaded.
      When a loaded file is modified later, it is reloaded and re-injected.

  --europe
      A synonym for '--default-charset ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy shortcut
      for commonly incorrect signalization on some European satellites. In that
      signalization, the character encoding is ISO-8859-15, the most common
      encoding for Latin & Western Europe languages. However, this is not the
      default DVB character set and it should be properly specified in all
      strings, which is not the case with some operators. Using this option,
      all DVB strings without explicit table code are assumed to use
      ISO-8859-15 instead of the standard ISO-6937 encoding.

  -f 'file-wildcard'
  --files 'file-wildcard'
      A file specification with optional wildcards indicating which event files
      should be polled. When such a file is created or updated, it is loaded
      and its content is interpreted as binary, XML or JSON tables.

      All tables shall be EIT's. The structure and organization of events
      inside the input EIT tables is ignored. All events are individually
      extracted from the EIT tables and loaded in the EPG. They are later
      reorganized in the injected EIT's p/f and schedule. In the input files,
      the EIT structure shall be only considered as a convenient format to
      describe events.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --incoming-eits
      Load events from incoming EIT's in the EPG. A typical use case is the
      generatation of EIT p/f from EIT schedule. By default, events are loaded
      from EIT files only.

  --japan
      A synonym for '--default-charset ARIB-STD-B24'. This is a handy shortcut
      when working on Japanese transport streams.

  --lazy-schedule-update
      When an event completes, do not remove it from the current EIT schedule
      segment. Obsolete events are removed from the EPG only when their 3-hour
      segment is completed. With this option, EIT schedule update is less
      frequent and the load on the plugin and the receiver is lower.

  --min-stable-delay milliseconds
      An input file size needs to be stable during that duration, in
      milliseconds, for the file to be reported as added or modified. This
      prevents too frequent poll notifications when a file is being written and
      his size modified at each poll. The default is 500 ms.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  --other
      Generate EIT other. If neither --actual nor --other are specified, both
      are generated.

  --pf
      Generate EIT p/f. If neither --pf nor --schedule are specified, both are
      generated.

  --philippines
      A synonym for '--default-charset RAW-UTF-8'. This is a handy shortcut
      when working on Philippines transport streams.

  --poll-interval milliseconds
      Interval, in milliseconds, between two poll operations to detect new or
      modified input files. The default is 500 ms.

  --prime-days value
      Duration, in days, of the "prime" period for EIT schedule. EIT schedule
      for events in the prime period (i.e. the next few days) are repeated more
      frequently than EIT schedule for later events. The default is 8 days.

  --schedule
      Generate EIT schedule. If neither --pf nor --schedule are specified, both
      are generated.

  --stuffing
      Insert stuffing inside TS packets at end of EIT sections. Do not pack EIT
      sections. By default, EIT sections are packed.

  --synchronous-versions
      Keep version numbers synchronous on all sections of an EIT subtable. By
      default, since EIT's are sparse sections and not full tables, the version
      number of an EIT section is updated only when the section is modified.

  --terrestrial
      Use the EIT cycle profile for terrestrial networks as specified in ETSI
      TS 101 211 section 4.4. By default, use the cycle profile for satellite
      and cable networks. See also options --cycle-* and --prime-days to modify
      individual values.

  --time value
      Specify the UTC date & time reference for the first packet in the stream.
      Then, the time reference is updated according to the number of packets
      and the bitrate. The time value can be in the format "year/month/day:
      hour:minute:second", or use the predefined name "system" for getting
      current time from the system clock. By default, the current time is
      resynchronized on all TDT and TOT. EIT injection starts when the time
      reference and actual transport stream id are known.

  --ts-id value
      Specify the actual transport stream id. This is used to differentiate
      events for EIT actual and EIT other. By default, the actual transport
      stream id is read from the PAT. EIT injection starts when the actual
      transport stream id and time reference are known.

  -w
  --wait-first-batch
      When this option is specified, the start of the plugin is suspended until
      the first batch of events is loaded from files. Without this option, the
      input files are asynchronously loaded.
