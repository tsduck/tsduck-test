Analyze a FLUTE stream from a pcap or pcap-ng file

Usage: tsflute [options] [input-file]

Parameter:

  Input file in pcap or pcap-ng format, typically as saved by Wireshark. Use
  the standard input if no file name is specified.

Options:

  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  --delete-after seconds
      With --extract-carousel, delete the extracted files the specified number
      of seconds after their creation. This option is useful to prevent disk
      overflow when the file extraction runs continuously.

  -d [ip-address]:[port]
  --destination [ip-address]:[port]
      Only use UDP packets with the specified destination IP address and/or UDP
      port. Multiple options --destination can be specified. By default, use
      all UDP packets.

  --dump-flute-payload
      Same as --log-flute-packets and also dump the payload of each FLUTE
      packet.

  --dump-xml-files
      Dump the content of XML files when they are received.

  --extract-carousel directory-name
      Save all files in the FLUTE carousel. The specified path is a directory.
      The file hierarchy is recreated from this directory. When a FLUTE file
      name is an URI, the URI scheme is removed. The characters which are not
      allowed in file names are replaced with an underscore.

  --extract-destination [ip-address]:[port]
      With --extract-file, specify the destination IP address and/or UDP port
      of files. By default, extract the files with matching name and any IP
      destination.

  -e name-or-urn
  --extract-file name-or-urn
      Extract the specified file from the FLUTE carousel. The name-or-urn shall
      be the exact complete name of the file, as identified in the FDT. The
      option --extract-file can be specified several times. All files are
      extracted in the output directory which is specified in option
      --output-directory. The output base name of each file is the last part of
      the name-or-urn, after the last slash or colon.

  --extract-source ip-address
      With --extract-file, specify the source IP address of files. By default,
      extract the files with matching name and any IP source address.

  --extract-tsi value
      With --extract-file, specify the Transport Session Identifier (TSI) of
      files. By default, extract the files with matching name and any TSI.

  --first-date date-time
      Filter packets starting at the specified date. Use format YYYY/MM/DD:hh:
      mm:ss.mmm.

  --first-packet value
      Filter packets starting at the specified number. The packet numbering
      counts all captured packets from the beginning of the file, starting at
      1. This is the same value as seen on Wireshark in the leftmost column.

  --first-timestamp microseconds
      Filter packets starting at the specified timestamp in micro-seconds from
      the beginning of the capture. This is the same value as seen on Wireshark
      in the "Time" column (in seconds).

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --last-date date-time
      Filter packets up to the specified date. Use format YYYY/MM/DD:hh:mm:ss.
      mmm.

  --last-packet value
      Filter packets up to the specified number. The packet numbering counts
      all captured packets from the beginning of the file, starting at 1. This
      is the same value as seen on Wireshark in the leftmost column.

  --last-timestamp microseconds
      Filter packets up to the specified timestamp in micro-seconds from the
      beginning of the capture. This is the same value as seen on Wireshark in
      the "Time" column (in seconds).

  --log-fdt
      Log a message describing each FLUTE File Delivery Table (FDT).

  --log-files
      Log a message describing each received file.

  --log-flute-packets
      Log a message describing the structure of each FLUTE packet.

  --max-file-size value
      Maximum size of files to analyze or extract. Each received file is
      accumulated in memory, chunk by chunk, until the file is complete. After
      processing the file, all chunks are freeed. This option is useful when
      the stream contains many large files which clutter the memory during
      their reception. All files which are announced as larger than the
      specified size are ignored. By default, all files are received and
      analyzed or saved.

  --no-pager
      Do not send output through a pager process. By default, if the output
      device is a terminal, the output is paged.

  --output-directory directory-name
      Output directory for files which are extracted using option
      --extract-file. The default is the current directory.

  -o file-name
  --output-file file-name
      With --summary, save the report in the specified file. By default or if
      the specified path is '-', the report is written to standard output.

  --save-fdt file-name
      Save each FLUTE File Delivery Table (FDT) in a file. Each FDT instance is
      saved in a separate file. If the specified path is 'dir/fdt.xml' for
      instance, the FDT with instance N is saved in file 'dir/fdt-N.xml'. If
      the specified path is '-', the file is written to standard output.

  --strict
      Apply a strict interpretation of protocols. By default, non-fatal
      misusages of the protocols are ignored.

  --summary
      Display a summary of the FLUTE sessions and files. This is the default if
      no other option is specified.

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version[=name]
      Display the TSDuck version number.
      The 'name' must be one of "acceleration", "all", "bitrate", "compiler",
      "crypto", "date", "dektec", "http", "integer", "long", "rist", "short",
      "srt", "system", "tls", "vatek", "zlib".

  --vlan-id value
      Filter packets from the specified VLAN id. This option can be specified
      multiple times. In that case, the values define nested VLAN ids, from the
      outer to inner VLAN.
