Scan a DTV network frequencies and services

Usage: tsscan [options]

There are three mutually exclusive types of network scanning. Exactly one of
the following options shall be specified: --nit-scan, --uhf-band, --vhf-band.

Options:

  --abnt
      Assume that the transport stream is an ISDB one with ABNT-defined
      variants. ISDB streams are normally automatically detected from their
      signalization but there is no way to determine if this is an original
      ARIB-defined ISDB or an ABNT-defined variant.

  -a N
  --adapter N
      This option can be used instead of device name.

  --atsc
      Assume that the transport stream is an ATSC one. ATSC streams are
      normally automatically detected from their signalization. This option is
      only useful when ATSC-related stuff are found in the TS before the first
      ATSC-specific table. For instance, when a PMT with ATSC-specific
      descriptors is found before the first ATSC MGT or VCT.

  --bandwidth value
      Bandwidth in Hz. For compatibility with old versions, low values (below
      1000) are interpreted in MHz. The default is 8,000,000 for DVB-T/T2 and
      6,000,000 for ISDB-T.

  --best-quality
      Obsolete option, do not use.

  --best-strength
      With UHF/VHF-band scanning, for each channel, use the offset with the
      best signal strength. By default, use the average of lowest and highest
      offsets with required minimum strength. Note that some tuners cannot
      report a correct signal strength, making this option useless.

  --brazil
      A synonym for '--isdb --abnt --default-charset RAW-ISO-8859-15
      --hf-band-region brazil'. This is a handy shortcut when working on South
      American ISDB-Tb transport streams.

  -c name
  --channel-transponder name
      Tune to the transponder containing the specified channel. The channel
      name is not case-sensitive and blanks are ignored. It is either an "HF
      band channel" or a "TV channel".

      An "HF band channel" has the format "band-number" such as "UHF-22"
      (terrestrial) or "BS-12" (Japanese satellite). See also option
      --offset-count.

      A "TV channel" name is searched in a "tuning file" and the corresponding
      tuning information in this file is used. See also option --tuning-file.

  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting strings from tables and
      descriptors. By default, DVB encoding using ISO-6937 as default table is
      used. The available table names are ARIB, ARIB-STD-B24, DUMP, DVB,
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6,
      ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, RAW-ISO-6937, RAW-ISO-8859-1,
      RAW-ISO-8859-10, RAW-ISO-8859-11, RAW-ISO-8859-13, RAW-ISO-8859-14,
      RAW-ISO-8859-15, RAW-ISO-8859-2, RAW-ISO-8859-3, RAW-ISO-8859-4,
      RAW-ISO-8859-5, RAW-ISO-8859-6, RAW-ISO-8859-7, RAW-ISO-8859-8,
      RAW-ISO-8859-9, RAW-UNICODE, RAW-UTF-16, RAW-UTF-8, UNICODE, UTF-16,
      UTF-8.

  --default-pds value
      Default private data specifier. This option is meaningful only when the
      signalization is incorrect, when DVB private descriptors appear in tables
      without a preceding private_data_specifier_descriptor. The specified
      value is used as private data specifier to interpret DVB private
      descriptors. The PDS value can be an integer or one of (not
      case-sensitive) names.
      The 'value' must be one of "AOM", "Astra", "Australia", "AVSA", "AVSV",
      "BskyB", "CanalPlus", "EACEM", "EICTA", "Eutelsat", "Logiways", "Nagra",
      "none", "NorDig", "OFCOM", "TPS".

  --default-registration value
      Default registration id. This option is meaningful only when the
      signalization is incorrect, when MPEG private descriptors appear in
      tables without a preceding registration_descriptor. The specified value
      is used as registration id (also know as format identifier) to interpret
      MPEG private descriptors or stream types.
      Several options --default-registration can be specified. Unlike DVB
      private data specifiers, several MPEG registration ids can be
      simultaneously defined.

  --delivery-system value
      Specify which delivery system to use. By default, use the default system
      for the tuner.
      With --nit-scan, this is the delivery system for the stream which
      contains the NIT to scan.
      With --uhf-band and --vhf-band, the option can be specified several
      times. In that case, the multiple delivery systems are tested in the
      specified order on each channel. This is typically used to scan
      terrestrial networks using DVB-T and DVT-T2. Be aware that the scan time
      is multiplied by the number of specified systems on channels without
      signal.
      The 'value' must be one of "ATSC", "ATSC-MH", "CMMB", "DAB", "DSS",
      "DTMB", "DVB-C", "DVB-C/A", "DVB-C/B", "DVB-C/C", "DVB-C2", "DVB-H",
      "DVB-S", "DVB-S-Turbo", "DVB-S2", "DVB-T", "DVB-T2", "ISDB-C", "ISDB-S",
      "ISDB-T", "undefined".

  -d name
  --device-name name
      By default, the first receiver device is used. Use the tslsdvb utility to
      list all DVB devices.

  --dvb
      Assume that the transport stream is a DVB one. DVB streams are normally
      automatically detected from their signalization. This option is only
      useful when possibly incorrect non-DVB stuff are found in the TS before
      the first DVB-specific table.

  --europe
      A synonym for '--dvb --default-charset ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy
      shortcut for commonly incorrect signalization on some European
      satellites. In that signalization, the character encoding is ISO-8859-15,
      the most common encoding for Latin & Western Europe languages. However,
      this is not the default DVB character set and it should be properly
      specified in all strings, which is not the case with some operators.
      Using this option, all DVB strings without explicit table code are
      assumed to use ISO-8859-15 instead of the standard ISO-6937 encoding.

  --fec-inner value
      Used for satellite and cable tuners only. Inner Forward Error Correction.
      The default is "auto".

      "13/45", "14/45", "23/36", "25/36", "26/45", "28/45", "32/45", "77/90",
      "auto", "none".

  --first-channel value
      For UHF/VHF-band scanning, specify the first channel to scan (default:
      lowest channel in band).

  --first-offset value
      For UHF/VHF-band scanning, specify the first offset to scan on each
      channel.

  -f value
  --frequency value
      Carrier frequency in Hz (all tuners). There is no default.

  -g
  --global-service-list
      Same as --service-list but display a global list of services at the end
      of scanning instead of per transport stream.

  --guard-interval value
      Used for terrestrial tuners only. Guard interval. The default is "1/32"
      for DVB-T/T2, "1/32" for ISDB-T.
      The 'value' must be one of "1/4", "1/8", "1/16", "1/32", "1/64", "1/128",
      "19/128", "19/256", "auto", "PN-420", "PN-595", "PN-945".

      regions are abnt, argentina, botswana, brazil, chile, ecuador, europe,
      france, japan, korea, north-america, paraguay, philippines,
      south-america, taiwan, uk, us, usa.

  --hierarchy value
      Used for DVB-T/T2 tuners only. The default is "none".
      The 'value' must be one of "1", "2", "4", "auto", "none".

  --high-priority-fec value
      Used for DVB-T/T2 tuners only. Error correction for high priority
      streams. The default is "auto".
      The 'value' must be one of "1/2", "1/3", "1/4", "2/3", "2/5", "3/4",
      "3/5", "4/5", "4/15", "5/6", "5/9", "5/11", "6/7", "7/8", "7/9", "7/15",

      Do not include explicit leap seconds in some UTC computations. Currently,
      this applies to SCTE 35 splice_schedule() commands only.

  --isdb
      Assume that the transport stream is an ISDB one. ISDB streams are
      normally automatically detected from their signalization. This option is
      only useful when ISDB-related stuff are found in the TS before the first
      ISDB-specific table.

  --isdbt-layer-a-fec value
      Used for ISDB-T tuners only. Error correction for layer A. The default is
      automatically detected.

      highest channel in band).

  --last-offset value
      For UHF/VHF-band scanning, specify the last offset to scan on each
      channel. Note that tsscan may scan higher offsets. As long as some signal
      is found at a specified offset, tsscan continues to check up to 3 higher
      offsets above the "last" one. This means that if a signal is found at
      offset +2, offset +3 will be checked anyway, etc. up to offset +5.

  --lnb name
      Used for satellite tuners only. Description of the LNB. The specified
      string is the name (or an alias for that name) of a preconfigured LNB in
      the configuration file tsduck.lnbs.xml. For compatibility, the legacy
      format 'low_freq[,high_freq,switch_freq]' is also accepted (all
      frequencies are in MHz). The default is a universal extended LNB.

  --low-priority-fec value
      Used for DVB-T/T2 tuners only. Error correction for low priority streams.
      The default is "auto".

      Obsolete option, do not use.

  --min-strength value
      Minimum signal strength. Frequencies with lower signal strength are
      ignored. The value can be in milli-dB or percentage. It depends on the
      tuner and its driver. Check the displayed unit. The default is 10,
      whatever unit it is.

  -m value
  --modulation value
      Used for DVB-C, DVB-T, DVB-S2 and ATSC tuners. Modulation type. The
      default is "64-QAM" for DVB-T/T2, "64-QAM" for DVB-C, "QPSK" for DVB-S2,

  -n
  --nit-scan
      Tuning parameters for a reference transport stream must be present
      (frequency or channel reference). The NIT is read on the specified
      frequency and a full scan of the corresponding network is performed.

  --no-offset
      For UHF/VHF-band scanning, scan only the central frequency of each
      channel. This is now the default. Specify option --use-offsets to scan
      all offsets.

  --offset-count value
      Used for terrestrial tuners only. Specify the number of offsets from the
      UHF or VHF channel. The default is zero. See options --uhf-channel or
      --vhf-channel.

      Used for DVB-S2 tuners only. Physical Layer Scrambling (PLS) code value.
      With multistream only. Warning: this option is supported on Linux only.

  --pls-mode mode
      Used for DVB-S2 tuners only. Physical Layer Scrambling (PLS) mode. With
      multistream only. The default is GOLD. Warning: this option is supported
      on Linux only.
      The 'mode' must be one of "GOLD", "ROOT".

  --polarity value
      Used for satellite tuners only. Polarity. The default is "vertical".
      The 'value' must be one of "auto", "horizontal", "left", "none", "right",
      "vertical".

      with DiSEqC switches and 0 to 1 for non-DiSEqC switches. The default is
      0. If you have cascaded switches, it is assumed that the DiSEqC 1.1
      switch is nearest to the receiver.

  --save-channels filename
      Save the description of all channels in the specified XML file. If the
      file name is "-", use the default tuning configuration file. See also
      option --update-channels.

  --sb-segment-count value
      Used for ISDB-T tuners only. With --sound-broadcasting, specify the total
      count of connected ISDB-Tsb channels. Possible values: 1 to 13. The
      default is 13.

  --sb-segment-index value
      Used for ISDB-T tuners only. With --sound-broadcasting, specify the index
      of the segment to be demodulated for an ISDB-Tsb channel where several of
      them are transmitted in the connected manner. Possible values: 0 to
      sb-segment-count - 1. The default is 0.

  --sb-subchannel-id value
      Used for ISDB-T tuners only. With --sound-broadcasting, specify the
      sub-channel id of the segment to be demodulated in the ISDB-Tsb channel.
      Possible values: 0 to 41. The default is 0.

  -l
  --service-list
      Read SDT of each channel and display the list of services.

  --show-modulation
      Display modulation parameters when possible. Note that some tuners cannot
      report correct modulation parameters, making this option useless.

  --signal-timeout seconds
      Specifies the timeout, in seconds, for DVB signal locking. If no signal
      is detected after this timeout, the command aborts. To disable the
      timeout and wait indefinitely for the signal, specify zero. The default
      is 5 seconds.

  --sound-broadcasting
      Used for ISDB-T tuners only. Specify that the reception is an ISDB-Tsb
      (sound broadcasting) channel instead of an ISDB-T one.

  --spectral-inversion value
      Spectral inversion. The default is "auto".
      The 'value' must be one of "auto", "off", "on".

  --stream-id value
      Used for ISDB-S tuners only. In the case of multi-stream broadcasting,
      specify the inner transport stream id. By default, use the first inner
      transport stream, if any is found. Warning: this option is supported on
      Linux only.

  -s value
  --symbol-rate value
      Used for satellite and cable tuners only. Symbol rate in symbols/second.
      The default is 27,500,000 sym/s for DVB-S, 6,900,000 sym/s for DVB-C, 28,
      860,000 sym/s for ISDB-S,

  --transmission-mode value
      Used for terrestrial tuners only. Transmission mode. The default is "8K"
      for DVB-T/T2, "8K" for ISDB-T.
      The 'value' must be one of "1K", "2K", "2K-interleaved", "4K",
      "4K-interleaved", "8K", "16K", "32K", "auto", "C=1", "C=3780".

  --tuning-file file-name
      Tuning configuration file to use for option -c or --channel-transponder.
      This is an XML file. See the TSDuck user guide for more details. Tuning
      configuration files can be created using the tsscan utility or the
      nitscan plugin. The location of the default tuning configuration file
      depends on the system.

  -u
  --uhf-band
      Perform a complete UHF-band scanning (DVB-T, ISDB-T or ATSC). Use the
      predefined UHF frequency layout of the specified region (see option
      --hf-band-region). By default, scan the center frequency of each channel
      only. Use option --use-offsets to scan all predefined offsets in each
      channel.

  --uhf-channel value
      Used for terrestrial tuners only. Specify the UHF channel number of the
      carrier. Can be used in replacement to --frequency. Can be combined with
      an --offset-count option. The UHF frequency layout depends on the region,
      see --hf-band-region option.

  --unicable value
      Used for satellite tuners only, in local Unicable distribution networks.
      Description of the Unicable switch. The value is of the form: <version>,
      <userband slot>,<userband frequency in MHz>. Version 1 indicates EN50494
      (Unicable I), version 2 indicates EN50607 (Unicable II).

  --update-channels filename
      Update the description of all channels in the specified XML file. The
      content of each scanned transport stream is replaced in the file. If the
      file does not exist, it is created. If the file name is "-", use the
      default tuning configuration file. The location of the default tuning
      configuration file depends on the system. See also option
      --save-channels.

  --usa
      A synonym for '--atsc --hf-band-region usa'. This is a handy shortcut
      when working on North American transport streams.

  --use-offsets
      For UHF/VHF-band scanning, do not scan only the central frequency of each
      channel. Also scan frequencies with offsets. As an example, if a signal
      is transmitted at offset +1, the reception may be successful at offsets
      -1 to +3 (but not -2 and +4). With this option, tsscan checks all offsets
      and reports that the signal is at offset +1. By default, tsscan reports
      that the signal is found at the central frequency of the channel (offset
      zero).

  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version[=name]
      Display the TSDuck version number.
      The 'name' must be one of "acceleration", "all", "bitrate", "compiler",
      "crypto", "date", "dektec", "http", "integer", "long", "rist", "short",
      "srt", "system", "tls", "vatek", "zlib".

  -v
  --vhf-band
      Perform a complete VHF-band scanning. See also option --uhf-band.

  --vhf-channel value
      Used for terrestrial tuners only. Specify the VHF channel number of the
      carrier. Can be used in replacement to --frequency. Can be combined with
      an --offset-count option. The VHF frequency layout depends on the region,
      see --hf-band-region option.
