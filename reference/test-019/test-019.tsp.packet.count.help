Count TS packets per PID

Usage: tsp -P count [options]

Options:

  -a
  --all
      Report packet index and PID for all packets from the selected PID's. By
      default, only a final summary is reported.

  -b
  --brief
      Brief display. Report only the numerical values, not comment on their
      usage.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i value
  --interval value
      Report a timestamp and global packet count at regular intervals. The
      specified value is a number of packets.

  -n
  --negate
      Negate the filter: specified PID's are excluded.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  -o filename
  --output-file filename
      Specify the output file for reporting packet counters. By default, report
      on standard error using the tsp logging mechanism.

  -p pid1[-pid2]
  --pid pid1[-pid2]
      PID filter: select packets with these PID values. Several -p or --pid
      options may be specified. By default, if --pid is not specified, all
      PID's are selected.

  -s
  --summary
      Display a final summary of packet counts per PID. This is the default,
      unless --all or --total is specified, in which case the final summary is
      reported only if --summary is specified.

  --tag 'string'
      Message tag to be displayed with count report lines. Useful when the
      plugin is used several times in the same process.

  -t
  --total
      Display the total packet counts in all PID's.
