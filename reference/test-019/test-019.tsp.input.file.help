Read packets from one or more files

Usage: tsp -I file [options] [file-name ...]

Parameters:

  Names of the input files. If no file is specified, the standard input is
  used. When several files are specified, use '-' as file name to specify the
  standard input. The files are read in sequence, unless --interleave is
  specified.

Options:

  --add-start-stuffing count
      Specify that <count> null TS packets must be automatically inserted at
      the start of the input file, before the first actual packet in the file.
      If several input files are specified, several options
      --add-start-stuffing are allowed. If there are less options than input
      files, the last value is used for subsequent files.

  --add-stop-stuffing count
      Specify that <count> null TS packets must be automatically appended at
      the end of the input file, after the last actual packet in the file. If
      several input files are specified, several options --add-stop-stuffing
      are allowed. If there are less options than input files, the last value
      is used for subsequent files.

  -b value
  --byte-offset value
      Start reading each file at the specified byte offset (default: 0). This
      option is allowed only if all input files are regular files.

  -f
  --first-terminate
      With --interleave, terminate when any file reaches the end of file. By
      default, continue reading until the last file reaches the end of file
      (other files are replaced with null packets after their end of file).

  --format name
      Specify the format of the input TS file. By default, the format is
      automatically detected. But the auto-detection may fail in some cases
      (for instance when the first time-stamp of an M2TS file starts with
      0x47). Using this option forces a specific format.
      Must be one of "M2TS", "RS204", "TS", "autodetect", "duck".

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i
  --infinite
      Repeat the playout of the file infinitely (default: only once). This
      option is allowed only if the input file is a regular file.

  --interleave[=value]
      Interleave files instead of reading them one by one. All files are
      simultaneously opened. The optional value is a chunk size N, a packet
      count (default is 1). N packets are read from the first file, then N from
      the second file, etc. and then loop back to N packets again from the
      first file, etc.

  -l value
  --label-base value
      Set a label on each input packet. Packets from the first file are tagged
      with the specified base label, packets from the second file with base
      label plus one, and so on. For a given file, if the computed label is
      above the maximum (31), its packets are not labelled.

  -p value
  --packet-offset value
      Start reading each file at the specified TS packet (default: 0). This
      option is allowed only if all input files are regular files.

  -r value
  --repeat value
      Repeat the playout of each file the specified number of times (default:
      only once). This option is allowed only if all input files are regular
      files.
