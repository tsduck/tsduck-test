Fork a process and receive TS packets from its standard output

Usage: tsp -I fork [options] 'command'

Parameter:

  Specifies the command line to execute in the created process.

Options:

  -b value
  --buffered-packets value
      Windows only: Specifies the pipe buffer size in number of TS packets.

  --format name
      Specify the format of the input TS file. By default, the format is
      automatically detected. But the auto-detection may fail in some cases
      (for instance when the first timestamp of an M2TS file starts with 0x47).
      Using this option forces a specific format.
      The 'name' must be one of "autodetect", "duck", "M2TS", "RS204", "TS".

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -n
  --nowait
      Do not wait for child process termination at end of its output.
