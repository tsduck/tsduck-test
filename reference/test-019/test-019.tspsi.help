Extract all standard PSI from an MPEG transport stream

Usage: tspsi [options] [filename]

Parameter:

  Input MPEG capture file (standard input if omitted).

Options:

  --abnt
      Assume that the transport stream is an ISDB one with ABNT-defined
      variants. ISDB streams are normally automatically detected from their
      signalization but there is no way to determine if this is an original
      ARIB-defined ISDB or an ABNT-defined variant.

  -a
  --all-versions
      Display all versions of PSI tables (need to read the complete transport
      stream). By default, display only the first version of each PSI table and
      stop when all expected PSI are extracted.

  --atsc
      Assume that the transport stream is an ATSC one. ATSC streams are
      normally automatically detected from their signalization. This option is
      only useful when ATSC-related stuff are found in the TS before the first
      ATSC-specific table. For instance, when a PMT with ATSC-specific
      descriptors is found before the first ATSC MGT or VCT.

  --brazil
      A synonym for '--isdb --abnt --default-charset RAW-ISO-8859-15
      --time-reference UTC-3'. This is a handy shortcut when working on South
      American ISDB-Tb transport streams.

  -c
  --c-style
      Same as --raw-dump (no interpretation of section) but dump the bytes in
      C-language style.

  --cat-only
      Display only the CAT, ignore other PSI tables.

  --clear
      Indicate that this is a clear transport stream, without conditional
      access information. Useful to avoid reading the complete transport
      stream, waiting for a non-existent CAT.

  --conax
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x0B00.

  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  --default-cas-id value
      Interpret all EMM's and ECM's from unknown CAS as coming from the
      specified CA_System_Id. By default, EMM's and ECM's are interpreted
      according to the CA_descriptor which references their PID. This option is
      useful when analyzing partial transport streams without CAT or PMT to
      correctly identify the CA PID's.

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting strings from tables and
      descriptors. By default, DVB encoding using ISO-6937 as default table is
      used. The available table names are ARIB, ARIB-STD-B24, DUMP, DVB,
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6,
      ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, RAW-ISO-6937, RAW-ISO-8859-1,
      RAW-ISO-8859-10, RAW-ISO-8859-11, RAW-ISO-8859-13, RAW-ISO-8859-14,
      RAW-ISO-8859-15, RAW-ISO-8859-2, RAW-ISO-8859-3, RAW-ISO-8859-4,
      RAW-ISO-8859-5, RAW-ISO-8859-6, RAW-ISO-8859-7, RAW-ISO-8859-8,
      RAW-ISO-8859-9, RAW-UNICODE, RAW-UTF-8, UNICODE, UTF-8.

  --default-pds value
      Default private data specifier. This option is meaningful only when the
      signalization is incorrect, when DVB private descriptors appear in tables
      without a preceding private_data_specifier_descriptor. The specified
      value is used as private data specifier to interpret DVB private
      descriptors. The PDS value can be an integer or one of (not
      case-sensitive) names.
      The 'value' must be one of "AOM", "Australia", "AVSA", "AVSV", "BskyB",
      "CanalPlus", "cuvv", "EACEM", "EICTA", "Eutelsat", "Logiways", "Nagra",
      "NorDig", "OFCOM", "TPS".

  --default-registration value
      Default registration id. This option is meaningful only when the
      signalization is incorrect, when MPEG private descriptors appear in
      tables without a preceding registration_descriptor. The specified value
      is used as registration id (also know as format identifier) to interpret
      MPEG private descriptors or stream types.
      Several options --default-registration can be specified. Unlike DVB
      private data specifiers, several MPEG registration ids can be
      simultaneously defined.

  -d
  --dump
      Dump all PSI sections.

  --dvb
      Assume that the transport stream is a DVB one. DVB streams are normally
      automatically detected from their signalization. This option is only
      useful when possibly incorrect non-DVB stuff are found in the TS before
      the first DVB-specific table.

  --europe
      A synonym for '--dvb --default-charset ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy
      shortcut for commonly incorrect signalization on some European
      satellites. In that signalization, the character encoding is ISO-8859-15,
      the most common encoding for Latin & Western Europe languages. However,
      this is not the default DVB character set and it should be properly
      specified in all strings, which is not the case with some operators.
      Using this option, all DVB strings without explicit table code are
      assumed to use ISO-8859-15 instead of the standard ISO-6937 encoding.

  --exclude-current
      Exclude PSI tables with "current" indicator. This is rarely necessary.
      See also --include-next.

  --format name
      Specify the format of the input TS file. By default, the format is
      automatically detected. But the auto-detection may fail in some cases
      (for instance when the first time-stamp of an M2TS file starts with
      0x47). Using this option forces a specific format.
      The 'name' must be one of "autodetect", "duck", "M2TS", "RS204", "TS".

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --ignore-leap-seconds
      Do not include explicit leap seconds in some UTC computations. Currently,
      this applies to SCTE 35 splice_schedule() commands only.

  --include-next
      Include PSI tables with "next" indicator. By default, they are excluded.

  --irdeto
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x0600.

  --isdb
      Assume that the transport stream is an ISDB one. ISDB streams are
      normally automatically detected from their signalization. This option is
      only useful when ISDB-related stuff are found in the TS before the first
      ISDB-specific table.

  --japan
      A synonym for '--isdb --default-charset ARIB-STD-B24 --time-reference
      JST'. This is a handy shortcut when working on Japanese transport
      streams.

  -j filename
  --json-output filename
      Save the tables in JSON format in the specified file. The tables are
      initially formatted as XML and automated XML-to-JSON conversion is
      applied. To output the JSON text on the standard output, explicitly
      specify this option with "-" as output file name.

  --log-json-line[='prefix']
      Log each table as one single JSON line in the message logger instead of
      an output file. The table is formatted as XML and automated XML-to-JSON
      conversion is applied. The optional string parameter specifies a prefix
      to prepend on the log line before the JSON text to locate the appropriate
      line in the logs.

  --log-xml-line[='prefix']
      Log each table as one single XML line in the message logger instead of an
      output file. The optional string parameter specifies a prefix to prepend
      on the log line before the XML text to locate the appropriate line in the
      logs.

  --mediaguard
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x0100.

  --nagravision
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x1800.

  --nds
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x0900.

  --nested-tlv[=min-size]
      With option --tlv, try to interpret the value field of each TLV record as
      another TLV area. If the min-size value is specified, the nested TLV
      interpretation is performed only on value fields larger than this size.
      The syntax of the nested TLV is the same as the enclosing TLV.

  --no-pager
      Do not send output through a pager process. By default, if the output
      device is a terminal, the output is paged.

  -o filename
  --output-file filename
      Save the tables in human-readable text format in the specified file. By
      default, when no output option is specified, text is produced on the
      standard output. If you need text formatting on the standard output in
      addition to other output such as XML, explicitly specify this option with
      "-" as output file name.

  --philippines
      A synonym for '--isdb --abnt --default-charset RAW-UTF-8 --time-reference
      UTC+8'. This is a handy shortcut when working on Philippines transport
      streams.

  -r
  --raw-dump
      Raw dump of section, no interpretation.

  --safeaccess
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x4ADC.

  --strict-xml
      Save XML documents in strictly conformant XML format. By default, do not
      escape characters when this is not syntactically necessary to make the
      XML text more human-readable.

  --text-output filename
      A synonym for --output-file.

  --time-reference name
      Use a non-standard (non-UTC) time reference in TDT/TOT. This is typically
      used in ARIB ISDB and ABNT ISDB-Tb standards. The specified name can be
      either 'UTC', 'JST' (Japan Standard Time) or 'UTC+|-hh[:mm]'. Examples:
      'UTC+9' (same as 'JST' for ARIB ISDB), 'UTC-3' (for ABNT ISDB-Tb in
      Brazil).

  --tlv value
      For sections of unknown types, this option specifies how to interpret
      some parts of the section payload as TLV records. Several --tlv options
      are allowed, each one describes a part of the section payload.

      Each syntax string has the form "start,size,tagSize,lengthSize,order".
      The start and size fields define the offset and size of the TLV area in
      the section payload. If the size field is "auto", the TLV extends up to
      the end of the section. If the start field is "auto", the longest TLV
      area in the section payload will be used. The fields tagSize and
      lengthSize indicate the size in bytes of the Tag and Length fields in the
      TLV structure. The field order must be either "msb" or "lsb" and
      indicates the byte order of the Tag and Length fields.

      All fields are optional. The default values are "auto,auto,1,1,msb".

  --usa
      A synonym for '--atsc'. This is a handy shortcut when working on North
      American transport streams.

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version[=name]
      Display the TSDuck version number.
      The 'name' must be one of "acceleration", "all", "bitrate", "compiler",
      "crypto", "date", "dektec", "http", "integer", "long", "nsis", "rist",
      "short", "srt", "system", "vatek".

  --viaccess
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x0500.

  --widevine
      Equivalent to --default-cas-id 0x4AD4.

  --x2j-collapse-text
      In the XML-to-JSON conversion, remove leading and trailing spaces and
      replace all other sequences of space characters by one single space in
      all text nodes. By default, text nodes are collapsed only when there is
      an XML model which identifies the text node as containing hexadecimal
      content.

  --x2j-enforce-boolean
      In the XML-to-JSON conversion, when an element attribute contains a
      boolean value but there is no XML model file to tell if this is really a
      boolean, force the creation of a JSON boolean. By default, when there is
      no XML model, all element attributes are converted as JSON strings.

  --x2j-enforce-integer
      In the XML-to-JSON conversion, when an element attribute contains an
      integer value but there is no XML model file to tell if this is really an
      integer, force the creation of a JSON number. By default, when there is
      no XML model, all element attributes are converted as JSON strings.

  --x2j-include-root
      In the XML-to-JSON conversion, keep the root of the XML document as a
      JSON object. By default, the JSON document is made of an array of all XML
      elements under the root.

  --x2j-trim-text
      In the XML-to-JSON conversion, remove leading and trailing spaces in all
      text nodes. By default, text nodes are trimmed only when there is an XML
      model which identifies the text node as containing hexadecimal content.

  -x filename
  --xml-output filename
      Save the tables in XML format in the specified file. To output the XML
      text on the standard output, explicitly specify this option with "-" as
      output file name.
