Inject tables and sections in a TS

Usage: tsp -P inject [options] input-file[=rate] ...

Parameters:

  Input binary, XML or JSON files containing one or more sections or tables. By
  default, files ending in .bin, .xml or .json are automatically recognized.
  For other file names, explicitly specify --binary, --xml or --json.

  The reference source format is XML. JSON files are first translated to XML
  using the "automated XML-to-JSON conversion" rules of TSDuck and then
  compiled to binary.

  If different repetition rates are required for different files, a parameter
  can be "filename=value" where value is the repetition rate in milliseconds
  for all sections in that file.

  If a name starts with "<?xml", it is considered as "inline XML content".

Options:

  --binary
      Specify that all input files are binary, regardless of their file name.

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      Specifies the bitrate for the new PID, in bits/second.
      The value must be a 64-bit floating-point value.

  --brazil
      A synonym for '--default-charset RAW-ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy
      shortcut when working on South American ISDB-Tb transport streams.

  --china
      A synonym for ''. This is a handy shortcut when working on Chinese
      transport streams.

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting strings from tables and
      descriptors. By default, DVB encoding using ISO-6937 as default table is
      used. The available table names are ARIB, ARIB-STD-B24, DUMP, DVB,
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6,
      ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, RAW-ISO-6937, RAW-ISO-8859-1,
      RAW-ISO-8859-10, RAW-ISO-8859-11, RAW-ISO-8859-13, RAW-ISO-8859-14,
      RAW-ISO-8859-15, RAW-ISO-8859-2, RAW-ISO-8859-3, RAW-ISO-8859-4,
      RAW-ISO-8859-5, RAW-ISO-8859-6, RAW-ISO-8859-7, RAW-ISO-8859-8,
      RAW-ISO-8859-9, RAW-UNICODE, RAW-UTF-16, RAW-UTF-8, UNICODE, UTF-16,
      UTF-8.

  --eit-actual
      With --eit-normalization, generate EIT actual. Same as --eit-actual-pf
      --eit-actual-schedule.

  --eit-actual-pf
      With --eit-normalization, generate EIT actual p/f. If no option is
      specified, all EIT sections are generated.

  --eit-actual-schedule
      With --eit-normalization, generate EIT actual schedule. If no option is
      specified, all EIT sections are generated.

  --eit-base-date date
      With --eit-normalization, use the specified date as reference for the
      allocation of the various EIT events in sections and segments. The date
      must be in the format "year/month/day [hh:mm:ss]". If only the date is
      present, it is used as base for the allocation of EIT schedule. If the
      time is also specified, it is the current time for the snapshot of EIT
      present/following. By default, use the oldest date in all EIT sections as
      base date.

  --eit-normalization
      Reorganize all EIT sections according to ETSI TS 101 211 rules. One
      single EIT p/f subtable is built per service. It is split in two
      sections, one for present and one for following events. All EIT schedule
      are kept but they are completely reorganized. All events are extracted
      and spread over new EIT sections according to ETSI TS 101 211 rules. If
      several files are specified, the reorganization of EIT's is performed
      inside each file independently. This is fine as long as all EIT's for a
      given service are in the same input file. See also option
      --eit-base-date.

  --eit-other
      With --eit-normalization, generate EIT other. Same as --eit-other-pf
      --eit-other-schedule.

  --eit-other-pf
      With --eit-normalization, generate EIT other p/f. If no option is
      specified, all EIT sections are generated.

  --eit-other-schedule
      With --eit-normalization, generate EIT other schedule. If no option is
      specified, all EIT sections are generated.

  --eit-pf
      With --eit-normalization, generate EIT p/f. Same as --eit-actual-pf
      --eit-other-pf.

  --eit-schedule
      With --eit-normalization, generate EIT schedule. Same as
      --eit-actual-schedule --eit-other-schedule.

  --europe
      A synonym for '--default-charset ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy shortcut
      for commonly incorrect signalization on some European satellites. In that
      signalization, the character encoding is ISO-8859-15, the most common
      encoding for Latin & Western Europe languages. However, this is not the
      default DVB character set and it should be properly specified in all
      strings, which is not the case with some operators. Using this option,
      all DVB strings without explicit table code are assumed to use
      ISO-8859-15 instead of the standard ISO-6937 encoding.

  -e value
  --evaluate-interval value
      When used with --replace and when specific repetition rates are specified
      for some input files, the bitrate of the target PID is re-evaluated on a
      regular basis. The value of this option specifies the number of packet in
      the target PID before re-evaluating its bitrate. The default is 100
      packets.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --fix-missing-pds
      When serializing XML MPEG or DVB private descriptors, automatically add
      missing registration descriptors and private data specifier descriptors.

  -f
  --force-crc
      Force recomputation of CRC32 in long sections. Ignore CRC32 values in
      input file.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i value
  --inter-packet value
      Specifies the packet interval for the new PID, that is to say the number
      of TS packets in the transport between two packets of the new PID. Use
      instead of --bitrate if the global bitrate of the TS cannot be
      determined.

  --japan
      A synonym for '--default-charset ARIB-STD-B24'. This is a handy shortcut
      when working on Japanese transport streams.

  -j
  --joint-termination
      Perform a "joint termination" when section insertion is complete.
      Meaningful only when --repeat is specified. See "tsp --help" for more
      details on "joint termination".

  --json
      Specify that all input files are JSON, regardless of their file name.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  --pack-and-flush
      When loading a binary section file, pack incomplete tables and flush
      them. Sections are renumbered to remove any hole between sections. Use
      with care because this may create inconsistent tables.

  --philippines
      A synonym for '--default-charset RAW-UTF-8'. This is a handy shortcut
      when working on Philippines transport streams.

  -p value
  --pid value
      PID of the output TS packets. This is a required parameter, there is no
      default value. To replace the content of an existing PID, use option
      --replace. To steal stuffing packets and create a new PID, use either
      option --bitrate or --inter-packet. Exactly one option --replace,
      --bitrate or --inter-packet must be specified.

  --poll-files
      Poll the presence and modification date of the input files. When a file
      is created, modified or deleted, reload all files at the next section
      boundary. When a file is deleted, its sections are no longer injected. By
      default, all input files are loaded once at initialization time and an
      error is generated if a file is missing.

  --repeat value
      Repeat the insertion of a complete cycle of sections the specified number
      of times. By default, the sections are infinitely repeated.

  -r
  --replace
      Replace the content of an existing PID. Do not steal stuffing.

  -s
  --stuffing
      Insert stuffing at end of each section, up to the next TS packet
      boundary. By default, sections are packed and start in the middle of a TS
      packet, after the previous section. Note, however, that section headers
      are never scattered over a packet boundary.

  -t
  --terminate
      Terminate packet processing when section insertion is complete.
      Meaningful only when --repeat is specified. By default, when section
      insertion is complete, the transmission continues and the stuffing is no
      longer modified (if --replace is specified, the PID is then replaced by
      stuffing).

  --xml
      Specify that all input files are XML, regardless of their file name.
