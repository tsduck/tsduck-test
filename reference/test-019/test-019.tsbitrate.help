Evaluate the bitrate of a transport stream

Usage: tsbitrate [options] [filename]

Parameter:

  MPEG capture file (standard input if omitted).

Options:

  -a
  --all
      Analyze all packets in the input file. By default, stop analysis when
      enough PCR information has been collected.

  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  -d
  --dts
      Use DTS (Decoding Time Stamps) from video PID's instead of PCR (Program
      Clock Reference) from the transport layer

  --format name
      Specify the format of the input TS file. By default, the format is
      automatically detected. But the auto-detection may fail in some cases
      (for instance when the first time-stamp of an M2TS file starts with
      0x47). Using this option forces a specific format.
      The 'name' must be one of "autodetect", "duck", "M2TS", "RS204", "TS".

  -f
  --full
      Full analysis. The file is entirely analyzed (as with --all) and the
      final report includes a complete per PID bitrate analysis.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i
  --ignore-errors
      Ignore transport stream errors such as discontinuities. When errors are
      not ignored (the default), the bitrate of the original stream (before
      corruptions) is evaluated. When errors are ignored, the bitrate of the
      received stream is evaluated, missing packets being considered as
      non-existent.

  --min-pcr value
      p analysis when that number of PCR are read from the required minimum
      number of PID (default: 64).

  --min-pid value
      Minimum number of PID's to get PCR from (default: 1).

  -v
  --value-only
      Display only the bitrate value, in bits/seconds, based on 188-byte
      packets. Useful to reuse the value in scripts.

  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version[=name]
      Display the TSDuck version number.
      The 'name' must be one of "acceleration", "all", "bitrate", "compiler",
      "crypto", "date", "dektec", "http", "integer", "long", "nsis", "rist",
      "short", "srt", "system", "vatek", "zlib".
