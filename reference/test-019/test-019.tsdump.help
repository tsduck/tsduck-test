Dump and format MPEG transport stream packets

Usage: tsdump [options] [filename ...]

Parameters:

  Any number of input MPEG TS files (standard input if omitted).

Options:

  --abnt
      Assume that the transport stream is an ISDB one with ABNT-defined
      variants. ISDB streams are normally automatically detected from their
      signalization but there is no way to determine if this is an original
      ARIB-defined ISDB or an ABNT-defined variant.

  --adaptation-field
      Include formatting of the adaptation field.

  -a
  --ascii
      Include ASCII dump in addition to hexadecimal.

  --atsc
      Assume that the transport stream is an ATSC one. ATSC streams are
      normally automatically detected from their signalization. This option is
      only useful when ATSC-related stuff are found in the TS before the first
      ATSC-specific table. For instance, when a PMT with ATSC-specific
      descriptors is found before the first ATSC MGT or VCT.

  -b
  --binary
      Include binary dump in addition to hexadecimal.

  --brazil
      A synonym for '--isdb --abnt'. This is a handy shortcut when working on
      South American ISDB-Tb transport streams.

  --buffer-size value
      Specify the UDP socket receive buffer size in bytes (socket option).

  --byte-offset value
      Start reading each file at the specified byte offset (default: 0). This
      option is allowed only if all input files are regular files.

  -c
  --c-style
      Same as --raw-dump (no interpretation of packet) but dump the bytes in
      C-language style.

  -d[level]
  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  --default-interface
      Let the system find the appropriate local interface on which to listen.
      By default, listen on all local interfaces.

  --disable-multicast-loop
      Disable multicast loopback. By default, incoming multicast packets are
      looped back on local interfaces, if an application sends packets to the
      same group from the same system. This option disables this.
      Warning: On input sockets, this option is effective only on Windows
      systems. On Unix systems (Linux, macOS, BSD), this option applies only to
      output sockets.

  --dvb
      Assume that the transport stream is a DVB one. DVB streams are normally
      automatically detected from their signalization. This option is only
      useful when possibly incorrect non-DVB stuff are found in the TS before
      the first DVB-specific table.

  --europe
      A synonym for '--dvb'.

  --first-source
      Filter UDP packets based on the source address. Use the sender address of
      the first received packet as only allowed source. This option is useful
      when several sources send packets to the same destination address and
      port. Accepting all packets could result in a corrupted stream and only
      one sender shall be accepted. To allow a more precise selection of the
      sender, use option --source. Options --first-source and --source are
      mutually exclusive.

  -f name
  --format name
      Specify the format of the input TS file. By default, the format is
      automatically detected. But the auto-detection may fail in some cases
      (for instance when the first time-stamp of an M2TS file starts with
      0x47). Using this option forces a specific format.
      The 'name' must be one of "autodetect", "duck", "M2TS", "RS204", "TS".

  -h
  --headers-only
      Dump packet headers only, not payload.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --ignore-leap-seconds
      Do not include explicit leap seconds in some UTC computations. Currently,
      this applies to SCTE 35 splice_schedule() commands only.

  --ip-udp [[source@]address:]port
      The [address:]port describes the destination of UDP packets to receive.
      The 'port' part is mandatory and specifies the UDP port to listen on. The
      'address' part is optional. It specifies an IP multicast address to
      listen on. It can be also a host name that translates to a multicast
      address. An optional source address can be specified as 'source@address:
      port' in the case of SSM.

  --isdb
      Assume that the transport stream is an ISDB one. ISDB streams are
      normally automatically detected from their signalization. This option is
      only useful when ISDB-related stuff are found in the TS before the first
      ISDB-specific table.

  --japan
      A synonym for '--isdb'. This is a handy shortcut when working on Japanese
      transport streams.

  --local-address ip-address
      Specify the IP address of the local interface on which to listen. It can
      be also a host name that translates to a local address. By default,
      listen on all local interfaces.

  -l
  --log
      Display a short one-line log of each packet instead of full dump.

  --log-size value
      With option --log, specify how many bytes are displayed in each packet.
      The default is 188 bytes (complete packet).

  -m value
  --max-packets value
      Maximum number of packets to dump per file.

  -n
  --nibble
      Same as --binary but add separator between 4-bit nibbles.

  --no-headers
      Do not display header information.

  --no-link-local
      Do not join multicast groups from link-local addresses. By default, join
      from all local interfaces.

  --no-pager
      Do not send output through a pager process. By default, if the output
      device is a terminal, the output is paged.

  --no-reuse-port
      Disable the reuse port socket option. Do not use unless completely
      necessary.

  -o
  --offset
      Include offset from start of packet with hexadecimal dump.

  --packet-offset value
      Start reading each file at the specified TS packet (default: 0). This
      option is allowed only if all input files are regular files.

  --payload
      Hexadecimal dump of TS payload only, skip TS header.

  --philippines
      A synonym for '--isdb --abnt'. This is a handy shortcut when working on
      Philippines transport streams.

  -p pid1[-pid2]
  --pid pid1[-pid2]
      Dump only packets with these PID values. Several --pid options may be
      specified. By default, all packets are displayed.

  -r
  --raw-file
      Raw dump of file, do not interpret as TS packets.

  --receive-timeout milliseconds
      Specify the UDP reception timeout in milliseconds. This timeout applies
      to each receive operation, individually. By default, receive operations
      wait for data, possibly forever.

  --reuse-port
      Set the reuse port socket option. This is now enabled by default, the
      option is present for legacy only.

  --rs204
      Dump the 16-byte trailer as found in RS204 files.

  --source ip-address[:port]
      Filter UDP packets based on the specified source address. This option is
      useful when several sources send packets to the same destination address
      and port. Accepting all packets could result in a corrupted stream and
      only one sender shall be accepted. Options --first-source and --source
      are mutually exclusive.

  --ssm
      Force the usage of Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) using the source which
      is specified by the option --source. The --ssm option is implicit when
      the syntax 'source@address:port' is used.

  --usa
      A synonym for '--atsc'. This is a handy shortcut when working on North
      American transport streams.

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version[=name]
      Display the TSDuck version number.
      The 'name' must be one of "acceleration", "all", "bitrate", "compiler",
      "crypto", "date", "dektec", "http", "integer", "long", "rist", "short",
      "srt", "system", "vatek", "zlib".
