Merge TS packets coming from the standard output of a command

Usage: tsp -P merge [options] 'command'

Parameter:

  Specifies the command line to execute in the created process.

Options:

  --acceleration-threshold value
      When the insertion of the merged stream is smoothened, packets are
      inserted in the main stream at some regular interval, leaving additional
      packets in the queue until their natural insertion point. However, to
      avoid losing packets, if the number of packets in the queue is above the
      specified threshold, the insertion is accelerated. When set to zero,
      insertion is never accelerated. The default threshold is half the size of
      the packet queue.

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      Specify the target bitrate of the merged stream, in bits/seconds. By
      default, the bitrate of the merged stream is computed from its PCR. The
      bitrate of the merged stream is used to smoothen packet insertion in the
      main stream.
      The value must be a 64-bit floating-point value.

  -d pid[-pid]
  --drop pid[-pid]
      Drop the specified PID or range of PID's from the merged stream. By
      default, the PID's 0x00 to 0x1F are dropped and all other PID's are
      passed. This can be modified using options --drop and --pass. Several
      options --drop can be specified.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  -f name
  --format name
      Specify the format of the input TS file. By default, the format is
      automatically detected. But the auto-detection may fail in some cases
      (for instance when the first timestamp of an M2TS file starts with 0x47).
      Using this option forces a specific format.
      The 'name' must be one of "autodetect", "duck", "M2TS", "RS204", "TS".

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i
  --ignore-conflicts
      Ignore PID conflicts. By default, when packets with the same PID are
      present in the two streams, the PID is dropped from the merged stream.
      Warning: this is a dangerous option which can result in an inconsistent
      transport stream.

  --incremental-pcr-restamp
      When restamping PCR's from the merged TS into the main TS, compute each
      new PCR from the last restampted one. By default, all PCR's are
      restampted from the initial PCR in the PID. The default method is more
      precise on constant bitrate (CBR) streams. The incremental method gives
      better results on variable bitrate (VBR) streams. See also option
      --no-pcr-restamp.

  -j
  --joint-termination
      Perform a "joint termination" when the merged stream is terminated. See
      "tsp --help" for more details on "joint termination".

  -m value
  --max-queue value
      Specify the maximum number of queued TS packets before their insertion
      into the stream. The default is 1,000.

  --no-pcr-restamp
      Do not restamp PCR's from the merged TS into the main TS. By default,
      PCR's in the merged stream are restamped to match their position in the
      final stream. The DTS and PTS are never restamped because they are
      independent from their position in the stream. When the PCR's in the
      merged stream have discontinuities (such as when cycling a TS file),
      restamping the PCR's can break the video playout since they become
      decorrelated with the DTS and PTS.

  --no-psi-merge
      Do not merge PSI/SI from the merged TS into the main TS. By default, the
      PAT, CAT, SDT and EIT are merged so that the services from the merged
      stream are properly referenced and PID's 0x00 to 0x1F are dropped from
      the merged stream.

  --no-smoothing
      Do not attempt to smoothen the insertion of the merged stream. Incoming
      packets from the merged stream are inserted as soon as null packets are
      available in the main stream. If the main stream contains a lot of null
      packets, this may lead to bursts in the merged packets. By default, if
      the bitrate of the merged stream is known, the merged packets are
      inserted at the target interval in the main stream.

  --no-wait
      Do not wait for child process termination at end of processing.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  -p pid[-pid]
  --pass pid[-pid]
      Pass the specified PID or range of PID's from the merged stream. By
      default, the PID's 0x00 to 0x1F are dropped and all other PID's are
      passed. This can be modified using options --drop and --pass. Several
      options --pass can be specified.

  --pcr-reset-backwards
      When restamping PCR's, the PCR adjustment is usually small and stays
      behind the PTS and DTS. But, after hours of continuous restamping, some
      inaccuracy my appear and the recomputed PCR may move ahead of PCR and
      DTS. With this option, as soon as a recomputed PCR is ahead of the PTS or
      DTS in the same packet, PCR restamping is reset and restarts from the
      original PCR value in this packet. Note that this creates a small PCR
      leap in the stream. The option has, of course, no effect on scrambled
      streams.

  --reset-label label1[-label2]
      Clear the specified labels on the merged packets. Apply to original
      packets from the merged stream only, not to updated PSI. Several
      --reset-label options may be specified.

  -r
  --restart
      Restart the merge command whenever it terminates or fails. By default,
      when packet insertion is complete, the transmission continues and the
      stuffing is no longer modified. The options --restart and --terminate are
      mutually exclusive.

  --restart-interval milliseconds
      With --restart, specify the duration to wait before restarting the merge
      command. By default, with --restart, the merge command is restarted
      immediately after termination.

  --set-label label1[-label2]
      Set the specified labels on the merged packets. Apply to original packets
      from the merged stream only, not to updated PSI. Several --set-label
      options may be specified.

  --terminate
      Terminate packet processing when the merged stream is terminated. By
      default, when packet insertion is complete, the transmission continues
      and the stuffing is no longer modified. The options --restart and
      --terminate are mutually exclusive.

  -t
  --transparent
      Pass all PID's without logical transformation. Equivalent to
      --no-psi-merge --ignore-conflicts --pass 0x00-0x1F.
