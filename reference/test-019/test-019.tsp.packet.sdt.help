Perform various transformations on the SDT

Usage: tsp -P sdt [options]

Options:

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      Specifies the bitrate in bits / second of the SDT PID if a new one is
      created. The default is 3,000 b/s.
      The value must be a 64-bit floating-point value.

  --brazil
      A synonym for '--default-charset RAW-ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy
      shortcut when working on South American ISDB-Tb transport streams.

  --china
      A synonym for ''. This is a handy shortcut when working on Chinese
      transport streams.

  --cleanup-private-descriptors
      Remove all private descriptors without preceding private_data_specifier
      descriptor.

  -c
  --create
      Create a new empty SDT if none was received after one second. This is
      equivalent to --create-after 1000.

  --create-after milliseconds
      Create a new empty SDT if none was received after the specified number of
      milliseconds. If the actual SDT is received later, it will be used as the
      base for transformations instead of the empty one.

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting strings from tables and
      descriptors. By default, DVB encoding using ISO-6937 as default table is
      used. The available table names are ARIB, ARIB-STD-B24, DUMP, DVB,
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6,
      ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, RAW-ISO-6937, RAW-ISO-8859-1,
      RAW-ISO-8859-10, RAW-ISO-8859-11, RAW-ISO-8859-13, RAW-ISO-8859-14,
      RAW-ISO-8859-15, RAW-ISO-8859-2, RAW-ISO-8859-3, RAW-ISO-8859-4,
      RAW-ISO-8859-5, RAW-ISO-8859-6, RAW-ISO-8859-7, RAW-ISO-8859-8,
      RAW-ISO-8859-9, RAW-UNICODE, RAW-UTF-16, RAW-UTF-8, UNICODE, UTF-16,
      UTF-8.

  --eit-pf value
      Specify a new EIT_present_following_flag value for the added or modified
      service. For new services, the default is 0.

  --eit-schedule value
      Specify a new EIT_schedule_flag value for the added or modified service.
      For new services, the default is 0.

  --europe
      A synonym for '--default-charset ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy shortcut
      for commonly incorrect signalization on some European satellites. In that
      signalization, the character encoding is ISO-8859-15, the most common
      encoding for Latin & Western Europe languages. However, this is not the
      default DVB character set and it should be properly specified in all
      strings, which is not the case with some operators. Using this option,
      all DVB strings without explicit table code are assumed to use
      ISO-8859-15 instead of the standard ISO-6937 encoding.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --expand-patch-xml
      Expand all environment variables in the patch files before patching. The
      expansion is performed each time a patch file is used. Therefore, if the
      values of the environment variables changed between two usages of the
      patch file, the latest up-to-date environment values are always used.

  -f value
  --free-ca-mode value
      Specify a new free_CA_mode value for the added or modified service. For
      new services, the default is 0.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i
  --increment-version
      Increment the version number of the SDT.

  --inter-packet value
      When a new SDT is created and --bitrate is not present, this option
      specifies the packet interval for the PID, that is to say the number of
      TS packets in the transport between two packets of the PID. Use instead
      of --bitrate if the global bitrate of the TS cannot be determined.

  --japan
      A synonym for '--default-charset ARIB-STD-B24'. This is a handy shortcut
      when working on Japanese transport streams.

  -n value
  --name value
      Specify a new service name for the added or modified service. For new
      services, the default is an empty string.

  -v value
  --new-version value
      Specify a new value for the version of the SDT.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  --original-network-id id
      Modify the original network id in the SDT with the specified value.

  -o id
  --other id
      Modify the SDT Other with the specified TS id. By default, modify the SDT
      Actual.

  --patch-xml filename
      Specify an XML patch file which is applied to all tables on the fly. If
      the name starts with "<?xml", it is considered as "inline XML content".
      Several --patch-xml options can be specified. Patch files are
      sequentially applied on each table.

  --philippines
      A synonym for '--default-charset RAW-UTF-8'. This is a handy shortcut
      when working on Philippines transport streams.

  -p value
  --provider value
      Specify a new provider name for the added or modified service. For new
      services, the default is an empty string.

  --remove-service id
      Remove the specified service_id from the SDT. Several --remove-service
      options may be specified to remove several services.

  -r value
  --running-status value
      Specify a new running_status (0 to 7) for the added or modified service.
      For new services, the default is 4 ("running").

  -s id
  --service-id id
      Add a new service or modify the existing service with the specified
      service-id.

  --ts-id id
      Modify the transport stream id in the SDT with the specified value.

  -t value
  --type value
      Specify a new service type for the added or modified service. For new
      services, the default is 0x01 ("digital television service").
