Extract T2-MI (DVB-T2 Modulator Interface) packets

Usage: tsp -P t2mi [options]

Options:

  -a
  --append
      With --output-file, if the file already exists, append to the end of the
      file. By default, existing files are overwritten.

  -e
  --extract
      Extract encapsulated TS packets from one PLP of a T2-MI stream. This is
      the default if neither --extract nor --log nor --identify is specified.
      By default, the transport stream is completely replaced by the extracted
      stream. See option --output-file.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i
  --identify
      Identify all T2-MI PID's and PLP's. If --pid is specified, only identify
      PLP's in this PID. If --pid is not specified, identify all PID's carrying
      T2-MI and their PLP's (require a fully compliant T2-MI signalization).

  -k
  --keep
      With --output-file, keep existing file (abort if the specified file
      already exists). By default, existing files are overwritten.

  -l
  --log
      Log all T2-MI packets using one single summary line per packet.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  -o filename
  --output-file filename
      Specify that the extracted stream is saved in this file. In that case,
      the main transport stream is passed unchanged to the next plugin.

  -p value
  --pid value
      Specify the PID carrying the T2-MI encapsulation. By default, use the
      first component with a T2MI_descriptor in a service.

  --plp value
      Specify the PLP (Physical Layer Pipe) to extract from the T2-MI
      encapsulation. By default, use the first PLP which is found. Ignored if
      --extract is not used.
