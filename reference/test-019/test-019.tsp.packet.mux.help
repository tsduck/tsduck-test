Insert TS packets in a transport stream

Usage: tsp -P mux [options] input-file

Parameter:

  Input transport stream file.

Options:

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      Specifies the bitrate for the inserted packets, in bits/second. By
      default, all stuffing packets are replaced which means that the bitrate
      is neither constant nor guaranteed.
      The value must be a 64-bit floating-point value.

  --byte-offset value
      Start reading the file at the specified byte offset (default: 0). This
      option is allowed only if the input file is a regular file.

  --except-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets without any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --except-label options may be specified. See
      also option --only-label. This is a generic option which is defined in
      all packet processing plugins.

  --format name
      Specify the format of the input TS file. By default, the format is
      automatically detected. But the auto-detection may fail in some cases
      (for instance when the first timestamp of an M2TS file starts with 0x47).
      Using this option forces a specific format.
      The 'name' must be one of "autodetect", "duck", "M2TS", "RS204", "TS".

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i value
  --inter-packet value
      Specifies the packet interval for the inserted packets, that is to say
      the number of TS packets in the transport between two new packets. Use
      instead of --bitrate if the global bitrate of the TS cannot be
      determined.

  --inter-time value
      Specifies the time interval for the inserted packets, that is to say the
      difference between the nearest PCR clock value at the point of insertion
      in milliseconds. Example: 1000 will keep roughly 1 second space between
      two inserted packets. The default is 0, it means inter-time is disabled.
      Use --pts-pid to specify the PID carrying the PCR clock of interest.

  -j
  --joint-termination
      Perform a "joint termination" when the file insertion is complete. See
      "tsp --help" for more details on "joint termination".

  --max-insert-count value
      Stop inserting packets after this number of packets was inserted.

  --max-pts value
      Stop inserting packets when this PTS time has passed in the --pts-pid.

  --min-pts value
      Start inserting packets when this PTS time has passed in the --pts-pid.

  --no-continuity-update
      Do not update continuity counters in the inserted packets. By default,
      the continuity counters are updated in each inserted PID to preserve the
      continuity.

  --no-pid-conflict-check
      Do not check PID conflicts between the TS and the new inserted packets.
      By default, the processing is aborted if packets from the same PID are
      found both in the TS and the inserted packets.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. See also
      option --except-label. This is a generic option which is defined in all
      packet processing plugins.

  --packet-offset value
      Start reading the file at the specified TS packet (default: 0). This
      option is allowed only if the input file is a regular file.

  -p value
  --pid value
      Force the PID value of all inserted packets.

  --pts-pid value
      Defines the PID carrying PCR or PTS values for --min-pts and --max-pts.
      When no PTS values are found, PCR are used. PCR values are divided by
      300, the system clock sub-factor, to get the corresponding PTS values.

  -r value
  --repeat value
      Repeat the playout of the file the specified number of times. By default,
      the file is infinitely repeated. This option is allowed only if the input
      file is a regular file.

  --reset-label label1[-label2]
      Clear the specified labels on the muxed packets. Several --reset-label
      options may be specified.

  --set-label label1[-label2]
      Set the specified labels on the muxed packets. Several --set-label
      options may be specified.

  -t
  --terminate
      Terminate packet processing when the file insertion is complete. By
      default, when packet insertion is complete, the transmission continues
      and the stuffing is no longer modified.
