Perform various transformations on the BAT

Usage: tsp -P bat [options]

Options:

  --bitrate value
      Specifies the bitrate in bits / second of the BAT PID if a new one is
      created. The default is 3,000 b/s.
      The value must be a fixed-point value with up to 1 meaningful decimal
      digits.

  -b value
  --bouquet-id value
      Specify the bouquet id of the BAT to modify and leave other BAT's
      unmodified. By default, all BAT's are modified.

  --cleanup-private-descriptors
      Remove all private descriptors without preceding private_data_specifier
      descriptor.

  -c
  --create
      Create a new empty BAT if none was received after one second. This is
      equivalent to --create-after 1000.

  --create-after value
      Create a new empty BAT if none was received after the specified number of
      milliseconds. If the actual BAT is received later, it will be used as the
      base for transformations instead of the empty one.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i
  --increment-version
      Increment the version number of the BAT.

  --inter-packet value
      When a new BAT is created and --bitrate is not present, this option
      specifies the packet interval for the PID, that is to say the number of
      TS packets in the transport between two packets of the PID. Use instead
      of --bitrate if the global bitrate of the TS cannot be determined.

  -v value
  --new-version value
      Specify a new value for the version of the BAT.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  --patch-xml filename
      Specify an XML patch file which is applied to all tables on the fly. If
      the name starts with "<?xml", it is considered as "inline XML content".
      Several --patch-xml options can be specified. Patch files are
      sequentially applied on each table.

  --pds value
      With option --remove-descriptor, specify the private data specifier which
      applies to the descriptor tag values above 0x80.

  --remove-descriptor value
      Remove from the BAT all descriptors with the specified tag. Several
      --remove-descriptor options may be specified to remove several types of
      descriptors. See also option --pds.

  -r value
  --remove-service value
      Remove the specified service_id from the following descriptors:
      service_list_descriptor, logical_channel_number_descriptor. Several
      --remove-service options may be specified to remove several services.

  --remove-ts value
      Remove the specified ts_id from the BAT. Several --remove-ts options may
      be specified to remove several TS.
