Scan a DTV network frequencies and services

Usage: tsscan [options]

There are three mutually exclusive types of network scanning. Exactly one of
the following options shall be specified: --nit-scan, --uhf-band, --vhf-band.

Options:

  -a N
  --adapter N
      Specifies the Linux DVB adapter N (/dev/dvb/adapterN). This option can be
      used instead of device name.

  --bandwidth value
      Used for terrestrial tuners only. Bandwidth. The default is "8-MHz" for
      DVB-T/T2, "6-MHz" for ISDB-T.
      Must be one of "1.712-MHz", "10-MHz", "5-MHz", "6-MHz", "7-MHz", "8-MHz",
      "auto".

  --best-quality
      With UHF/VHF-band scanning, for each channel, use the offset with the
      best signal quality. By default, use the average of lowest and highest
      offsets with required minimum quality and strength. Note that some tuners
      cannot report a correct signal quality, making this option useless.

  --best-strength
      With UHF/VHF-band scanning, for each channel, use the offset with the
      best signal strength. By default, use the average of lowest and highest
      offsets with required minimum quality and strength. Note that some tuners
      cannot report a correct signal strength, making this option useless.

  --brazil
      A synonym for '--default-charset RAW-ISO-8859-15 --hf-band-region
      brazil'. This is a handy shortcut when working on South American ISDB-Tb
      transport streams.

  -c name
  --channel-transponder name
      Tune to the transponder containing the specified channel. The channel
      name is not case-sensitive and blanks are ignored. It is either an "HF
      band channel" or a "TV channel".

      An "HF band channel" has the format "band-number" such as "UHF-22"
      (terrestrial) or "BS-12" (Japanese satellite). See also option
      --offset-count.

      A "TV channel" name is searched in a "tuning file" and the corresponding
      tuning information in this file is used. See also option --tuning-file.

  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting strings from tables and
      descriptors. By default, DVB encoding using ISO-6937 as default table is
      used. The available table names are ARIB, ARIB-STD-B24, DUMP, DVB,
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6,
      ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, RAW-ISO-6937, RAW-ISO-8859-1,
      RAW-ISO-8859-10, RAW-ISO-8859-11, RAW-ISO-8859-13, RAW-ISO-8859-14,
      RAW-ISO-8859-15, RAW-ISO-8859-2, RAW-ISO-8859-3, RAW-ISO-8859-4,
      RAW-ISO-8859-5, RAW-ISO-8859-6, RAW-ISO-8859-7, RAW-ISO-8859-8,
      RAW-ISO-8859-9, RAW-UNICODE, RAW-UTF-8, UNICODE, UTF-8.

  --delivery-system value
      Specify which delivery system to use. By default, use the default system
      for the tuner.

      "DVB-C/A", "DVB-C/B", "DVB-C/C", "DVB-C2", "DVB-H", "DVB-S",
      "DVB-S-Turbo", "DVB-S2", "DVB-T", "DVB-T2", "ISDB-C", "ISDB-S", "ISDB-T",

  -d name
  --device-name name
      Specify the DVB receiver device name, /dev/dvb/adapterA[:F[:M[:V]]] where
      A = adapter number, F = frontend number (default: 0), M = demux number
      (default: 0), V = dvr number (default: 0). By default, the first receiver
      device is used. Use the tslsdvb utility to list all DVB devices.

  --europe
      A synonym for '--default-charset ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy shortcut
      for commonly incorrect signalization on some European satellites. In that
      signalization, the character encoding is ISO-8859-15, the most common
      encoding for Latin & Western Europe languages. However, this is not the
      default DVB character set and it should be properly specified in all
      strings, which is not the case with some operators. Using this option,
      all DVB strings without explicit table code are assumed to use
      ISO-8859-15 instead of the standard ISO-6937 encoding.

  --fec-inner value

      For UHF/VHF-band scanning, specify the first offset to scan on each
      channel.

  -f value
  --frequency value
      Carrier frequency in Hz (all tuners). There is no default.

  -g
  --global-service-list
      Same as --service-list but display a global list of services at the end
      of scanning instead of per transport stream.

  --guard-interval value
      Used for terrestrial tuners only. Guard interval. The default is "1/32"
      for DVB-T/T2, "1/32" for ISDB-T.
      Must be one of "1/128", "1/16", "1/32", "1/4", "1/8", "19/128", "19/256",

  --japan
      A synonym for '--default-charset ARIB-STD-B24 --hf-band-region japan'.
      This is a handy shortcut when working on Japanese transport streams.

  --last-channel value
      For UHF/VHF-band scanning, specify the last channel to scan (default:
      highest channel in band).

  --last-offset value
      For UHF/VHF-band scanning, specify the last offset to scan on each
      channel. Note that tsscan may scan higher offsets. As long as some signal
      is found at a specified offset, tsscan continues to check up to 3 higher
      offsets above the "last" one. This means that if a signal is found at
      offset +2, offset +3 will be checked anyway, etc. up to offset +5.

  --service-list
      Read SDT of each channel and display the list of services.

  --show-modulation
      Display modulation parameters when possible. Note that some tuners cannot
      report correct modulation parameters, making this option useless.

  --signal-timeout seconds
      Specifies the timeout, in seconds, for DVB signal locking. If no signal
      is detected after this timeout, the command aborts. To disable the
      timeout and wait indefinitely for the signal, specify zero. The default
      is 5 seconds.

  --sound-broadcasting
      Used for ISDB-T tuners only. Specify that the reception is an ISDB-Tsb
      (sound broadcasting) channel instead of an ISDB-T one.

  --tuning-file value
      Tuning configuration file to use for option -c or --channel-transponder.
      This is an XML file. See the TSDuck user's guide for more details. Tuning
      configuration files can be created using the tsscan utility or the
      nitscan plugin. The location of the default tuning configuration file
      depends on the system. On Linux, the default file is $HOME/.tsduck.
      channels.xml.

  -u
  --uhf-band
      Perform a complete UHF-band scanning (DVB-T, ISDB-T or ATSC). Use the
      predefined UHF frequency layout of the specified region (see option
      --hf-band-region). By default, scan the center frequency of each channel
      only. Use option --use-offsets to scan all predefined offsets in each
      channel.

  --uhf-channel value
      Used for terrestrial tuners only. Specify the UHF channel number of the
      carrier. Can be used in replacement to --frequency. Can be combined with
      an --offset-count option. The UHF frequency layout depends on the region,
      see --hf-band-region option.

  --update-channels filename
      Update the description of all channels in the specified XML file. The
      content of each scanned transport stream is replaced in the file. If the
      file does not exist, it is created. If the file name is "-", use the
      default tuning configuration file. The location of the default tuning
      configuration file depends on the system. On Linux, the default file is
      $HOME/.tsduck.channels.xml. See also option --save-channels.

  --use-offsets
      For UHF/VHF-band scanning, do not scan only the central frequency of each
      channel. Also scan frequencies with offsets. As an example, if a signal
      is transmitted at offset +1, the reception may be successful at offsets
      -1 to +3 (but not -2 and +4). With this option, tsscan checks all offsets
      and reports that the signal is at offset +1. By default, tsscan reports
      that the signal is found at the central frequency of the channel (offset
      zero).

  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version
      Display the TSDuck version number.

  -v
  --vhf-band
      Perform a complete VHF-band scanning. See also option --uhf-band.

  --vhf-channel value
      Used for terrestrial tuners only. Specify the VHF channel number of the
      carrier. Can be used in replacement to --frequency. Can be combined with
      an --offset-count option. The VHF frequency layout depends on the region,
      see --hf-band-region option.
