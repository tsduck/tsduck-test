Experimental AES scrambling of TS packets

Usage: tsp -P aes [options] [service]

Parameter:

  Specifies the service to scramble. If the argument is an integer value
  (either decimal or hexadecimal), it is interpreted as a service id.
  Otherwise, it is interpreted as a service name, as specified in the SDT. The
  name is not case sensitive and blanks are ignored. If the service is
  unspecified, individual PID's are scrambled (see option --pid).

Options:

  --cbc
      Use Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode without padding. The residue (last
      part of the packet payload, shorter than 16 bytes) is left clear.

  --cts1
      Use Cipher Text Stealing (CTS) mode, as defined by Bruce Schneier in its
      "Applied Cryptography" and by RFC 2040 as RC5-CTS. TS packets with a
      payload shorter than 17 bytes are left clear.

  --cts2
      Use Cipher Text Stealing (CTS) mode as defined in NIST's proposal. TS
      packets with a payload shorter than 16 bytes are left clear.

  --cts3
      Use ECB Cipher Text Stealing (ECB-CTS) mode, as defined by Wikipedia. TS
      packets with a payload shorter than 17 bytes are left clear.

  --cts4
      Use (weird) ECB Cipher Text Stealing (ECB-CTS) mode, as implemented in ST
      71xx chips. TS packets with a payload shorter than 17 bytes are left
      clear.

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting strings from tables and
      descriptors. By default, DVB encoding using ISO-6937 as default table is
      used. The available table names are ARIB, ARIB-STD-B24, DUMP, DVB,
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6,
      ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, RAW-ISO-6937, RAW-ISO-8859-1,
      RAW-ISO-8859-10, RAW-ISO-8859-11, RAW-ISO-8859-13, RAW-ISO-8859-14,
      RAW-ISO-8859-15, RAW-ISO-8859-2, RAW-ISO-8859-3, RAW-ISO-8859-4,
      RAW-ISO-8859-5, RAW-ISO-8859-6, RAW-ISO-8859-7, RAW-ISO-8859-8,
      RAW-ISO-8859-9, RAW-UNICODE, RAW-UTF-8, UNICODE, UTF-8.

  -d
  --descramble
      Descramble instead of scramble.

  --dvs042
      Use DVS 042 (now ANSI/SCTE 52 2003) cipher block chaining mode. TS
      packets with a payload shorter than 16 bytes are left clear.

  --ecb
      Use Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode without padding. The residue (last
      part of the packet payload, shorter than 16 bytes) is left clear. This is
      the default mode.

  --europe
      A synonym for '--default-charset ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy shortcut
      for commonly incorrect signalization on some European satellites. In that
      signalization, the character encoding is ISO-8859-15, the most common
      encoding for Latin & Western Europe languages. However, this is not the
      default DVB character set and it should be properly specified in all
      strings, which is not the case with some operators. Using this option,
      all DVB strings without explicit table code are assumed to use
      ISO-8859-15 instead of the standard ISO-6937 encoding.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  -i value
  --iv value
      Specifies the initialization vector. Must be a string of 32 hexadecimal
      digits. Must not be used in ECB mode. The default IV is all zeroes.

  --japan
      A synonym for '--default-charset ARIB-STD-B24'. This is a handy shortcut
      when working on Japanese transport streams.

  -k value
  --key value
      Specifies a fixed and constant AES key for all TS packets. The value must
      be a string of 32 or 64 hexadecimal digits. This is a mandatory
      parameter.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  -p pid1[-pid2]
  --pid pid1[-pid2]
      Specifies a PID to scramble. Can be used instead of specifying a service.
      Several -p or --pid options may be specified.
