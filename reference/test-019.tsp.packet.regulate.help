Regulate the TS packets flow based on PCR or bitrate

Usage: tsp -P regulate [options]

Options:

  -b value
  --bitrate value
      Specify a bitrate in b/s and regulate (slow down only) the TS packets
      flow according to this bitrate. By default, use the "input" bitrate,
      typically resulting from the PCR analysis of the input file.
      The value must be a 64-bit floating-point value.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  -p value
  --packet-burst value
      Number of packets to burst at a time. Does not modify the average output
      bitrate but influence smoothing and CPU load. The default is 16 packets.

  --pcr-synchronous
      Regulate the flow based on the Program Clock Reference from the transport
      stream. By default, use a bitrate, not PCR's.

  --pid-pcr value
      With --pcr-synchronous, specify the reference PID for PCR's. By default,
      use the first PID containing PCR's.

  -w value
  --wait-min value
      With --pcr-synchronous, specify the minimum wait time in milli-seconds.
      The default is 50 ms.
