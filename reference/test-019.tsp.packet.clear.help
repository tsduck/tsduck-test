Extract clear (non scrambled) sequences of a transport stream

Usage: tsp -P clear [options]

Options:

  -a
  --audio
      Check only audio PIDs for clear packets. By default, audio and video PIDs
      are checked.

  --brazil
      A synonym for '--default-charset RAW-ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy
      shortcut when working on South American ISDB-Tb transport streams.

  --default-charset name
      Default character set to use when interpreting strings from tables and
      descriptors. By default, DVB encoding using ISO-6937 as default table is
      used. The available table names are ARIB, ARIB-STD-B24, DUMP, DVB,
      ISO-6937, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14,
      ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6,
      ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, RAW-ISO-6937, RAW-ISO-8859-1,
      RAW-ISO-8859-10, RAW-ISO-8859-11, RAW-ISO-8859-13, RAW-ISO-8859-14,
      RAW-ISO-8859-15, RAW-ISO-8859-2, RAW-ISO-8859-3, RAW-ISO-8859-4,
      RAW-ISO-8859-5, RAW-ISO-8859-6, RAW-ISO-8859-7, RAW-ISO-8859-8,
      RAW-ISO-8859-9, RAW-UNICODE, RAW-UTF-8, UNICODE, UTF-8.

  -d value
  --drop-after-packets value
      Specifies the number of packets after the last clear packet to wait
      before stopping the packet transmission. By default, stop 1 second after
      the last clear packet (based on current bitrate).

  --europe
      A synonym for '--default-charset ISO-8859-15'. This is a handy shortcut
      for commonly incorrect signalization on some European satellites. In that
      signalization, the character encoding is ISO-8859-15, the most common
      encoding for Latin & Western Europe languages. However, this is not the
      default DVB character set and it should be properly specified in all
      strings, which is not the case with some operators. Using this option,
      all DVB strings without explicit table code are assumed to use
      ISO-8859-15 instead of the standard ISO-6937 encoding.

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --japan
      A synonym for '--default-charset ARIB-STD-B24'. This is a handy shortcut
      when working on Japanese transport streams.

  --only-label label1[-label2]
      Invoke this plugin only for packets with any of the specified labels.
      Other packets are transparently passed to the next plugin, without going
      through this one. Several --only-label options may be specified. This is
      a generic option which is defined in all packet processing plugins.

  --philippines
      A synonym for '--default-charset RAW-UTF-8'. This is a handy shortcut
      when working on Philippines transport streams.

  -s value
  --service value
      The extraction of clear sequences is based on one "reference" service.
      (see option -s). When a clear packet is found on any audio or video
      stream of the reference service, all packets in the TS are transmitted.
      When no clear packet has been found in the last second, all packets in
      the TS are dropped.

      This option specifies the reference service. If the argument is an
      integer value (either decimal or hexadecimal), it is interpreted as a
      service id. Otherwise, it is interpreted as a service name, as specified
      in the SDT. The name is not case sensitive and blanks are ignored. If
      this option is not specified, the first service in the PAT is used.

  --stuffing
      Replace excluded packets with stuffing (null packets) instead of removing
      them. Useful to preserve bitrate.

  -v
  --video
      Check only video PIDs for clear packets. By default, audio and video PIDs
      are checked.
