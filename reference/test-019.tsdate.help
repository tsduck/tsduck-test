Extract the date and time (TDT/TOT) from a transport stream

Usage: tsdate [options] [filename]

Parameter:

  MPEG capture file (standard input if omitted).

Options:

  --abnt
      Assume that the transport stream is an ISDB one with ABNT-defined
      variants. ISDB streams are normally automatically detected from their
      signalization but there is no way to determine if this is an original
      ARIB-defined ISDB or an ABNT-defined variant.

  -a
  --all
      Report all TDT/TOT tables (default: report only the first table of each
      type).

  --atsc
      Assume that the transport stream is an ATSC one. ATSC streams are
      normally automatically detected from their signalization. This option is
      only useful when ATSC-related stuff are found in the TS before the first
      ATSC-specific table. For instance, when a PMT with ATSC-specific
      descriptors is found before the first ATSC MGT or VCT.

  --brazil
      A synonym for '--isdb --abnt --time-reference UTC-3'. This is a handy
      shortcut when working on South American ISDB-Tb transport streams.

  -d[level]
  --debug[=level]
      Produce debug traces. The default level is 1. Higher levels produce more
      messages.

  -f name
  --format name
      Specify the format of the input TS file. By default, the format is
      automatically detected. But the auto-detection may fail in some cases
      (for instance when the first time-stamp of an M2TS file starts with
      0x47). Using this option forces a specific format.
      Must be one of "M2TS", "RS204", "TS", "autodetect", "duck".

  --help
      Display this help text.

  --ignore-leap-seconds
      Do not include explicit leap seconds in some UTC computations. Currently,
      this applies to SCTE 35 splice_schedule() commands only.

  --isdb
      Assume that the transport stream is an ISDB one. ISDB streams are
      normally automatically detected from their signalization. This option is
      only useful when ISDB-related stuff are found in the TS before the first
      ISDB-specific table.

  --japan
      A synonym for '--isdb --time-reference JST'. This is a handy shortcut
      when working on Japanese transport streams.

  --notdt
      Ignore Time & Date Table (TDT).

  --notot
      Ignore Time Offset Table (TOT).

  --philippines
      A synonym for '--isdb --abnt --time-reference UTC+8'. This is a handy
      shortcut when working on Philippines transport streams.

  --time-reference name
      Use a non-standard (non-UTC) time reference in TDT/TOT. This is typically
      used in ARIB ISDB and ABNT ISDB-Tb standards. The specified name can be
      either 'UTC', 'JST' (Japan Standard Time) or 'UTC+|-hh[:mm]'. Examples:
      'UTC+9' (same as 'JST' for ARIB ISDB), 'UTC-3' (for ABNT ISDB-Tb in
      Brazil).

  --usa
      A synonym for '--atsc'. This is a handy shortcut when working on North
      American transport streams.

  -v
  --verbose
      Produce verbose output.

  --version
      Display the TSDuck version number.
